Development setup
-----------------


Install Node.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OddSite development requires `Node.js`_ 8.4.0 and `yarn`_ 0.27.5.

The right versions of Node and yarn are bundled in the OddSite repo and can be
unpacked inside the repo (in the git-ignored ``node/`` directory), so you don't
have to install then system-wide (and possibly conflict with other projects
wanting other Node/yarn versions). Run ``bin/unpack-node`` to unpack into
``node/`` (this command also installs `yarn`_ for front-end package
management).

Next you need to make sure that whenever you are working on OddSite, you use
that OddSite-specific Node instead of any system-wide Node you may have.
Updating your ``PATH`` will achieve that::

    export ODDSITE=$HOME/projects/oddsite
    export PATH=$ODDSITE/node/bin:$ODDSITE/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

Make sure you adjust the first line to match the actual directory where your
clone of the OddSite repo lives (you can run ``pwd`` from within the OddSite
repo to find out the full path to it).

There are a variety of tools that let you set up environment variables
temporarily for a particular "environment" or directory. We use
`virtualenvwrapper`_, in which case you can just add the above two lines to the
``bin/postactivate`` script file inside your OddSite virtualenv directory (if
you don't know where that is, you can run ``cdvirtualenv`` with your OddSite
virtualenv activated to find it). Your ``PATH`` will be updated when you
``workon oddsite`` and restored when you ``deactivate``.

If you can run ``which yarn`` and see a path inside your OddSite repo ending
with ``.../node/bin/yarn``, then you've got it set up right and can move on.


Install front-end dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the necessary Node dependencies, run ``yarn``. You should re-run
this command whenever ``package.json`` and/or ``yarn.lock`` changes; it's safe
to run anytime.

After running ``yarn``, make sure that ``which gulp`` returns a path inside
your OddSite repo (should end with ``.../node_modules/.bin/gulp``), not a
system-wide path. If it doesn't, you may have set your ``PATH`` environment
variable incorrectly in the last step.

To **add** or **update** a front-end package, install the package with ``yarn
add <package_name>@<version> --exact [--dev]``.


Install back-end dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local development on this project requires `Python`_ 2.7. To install the Python
dependencies, run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` (you may want to run this
in a `virtualenv`_ to isolate it from other Python projects on your system).


Directory Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The site templates are in ``templates/``, content is in ``content/``, and
static files are in ``static/``.

To view the site live locally, run ``gulp serve`` and visit
``http://localhost:3000`` in your browser.

``gulp serve`` will also watch for changes to local files and automatically
perform an appropriate selection of the following tasks whenever changes are
detected to files in the ``templates/`` and ``content/`` directories:

* validate JS with `ESLint`_
* validate Sass with `Sass Lint`_
* compile the static assets with `Webpack`_
* regenerate the site as static HTML files under the ``dev-output/`` directory

To perform these tasks manually, run ``gulp``. To watch for changes without
starting a local server, run ``gulp watch``. Refer to the ``gulpfile.js``
source and `gulp`_ documentation for more info.

Deployment
----------

The site is deployed on Github Pages. The ``output/`` directory (which is git-
ignored) should be its own git repo (`github.com/oddbird/oddbird.github.com`_,
which is also the deployment on Github Pages).

To deploy, first be sure that the ``output/`` directory contains the correct
git repo; if not, run ``git clone git@github.com:oddbird/oddbird.github.com
output`` to set it up.

Before deploying, ``cd output/`` and ``git pull`` to be sure you have the
latest code. Then, back in the parent directory (``cd ..``), run ``gulp prod``
to build the site under ``output/``. Run ``gulp prod-serve`` to view your
changes to the production code before committing. When satisfied, ``cd
output/``, commit those changes and then ``git push`` to deploy it live.
