      Herman is my documentation dream come true,
      especially when it comes to systems design.

  Fully-integrated style documentation
  for **automated pattern libraries**
  and **style guides** on a budget.
summary: |
  **Design systems streamline development,
  communication, and consistency** --
  but often rely on dedicated
  teams and extended budgets.
  We wanted a tool that helps create and maintain
  living style guides & pattern libraries in an
  agile process, and on a budget.
  Herman helps you keep your development process simple --
  and your UX consistent --
  as you iterate on patterns and scale over time.

  Start `using Herman`_ or `hire us`_
  for design systems training.

Give Your Design System a Home
------------------------------

Documentation should be the default option --
the path of least resistance for developers.
Herman combines documentation of design tokens
and system guidelines, with code patterns, components,
and rendered visual examples -- all driven by Sass and CSS.
By automating as much of the documentation as possible,
you can help ensure that everything stays up-to-date for
long-term maintainability.

Help improve communication across stakeholders,
with consistency in UX, performance, and accessibility --
while reducing technical debt and
minimizing long-term maintenance.
Herman is designed to grow with you,
and keep everything in one place.
