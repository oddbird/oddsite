summary: |
  **Come check out some battle-tested tools for improving your Python testing.**
  I'll demonstrate intermediate and advanced features of py.test
  (fixtures, parametrized tests),
  testing web applications with WebTest,
  testing across a matrix of multiple Python
  and dependency versions with tox,
  writing test doubles, stubs, and spies with mock and pretend,
  and measuring code coverage with coverage.py.
