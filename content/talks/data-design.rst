  Learn to **integrate design and code**
  to isolate components and
  automate style documentation
  with a **design system built for your needs**.
summary: |
  **CSS has come a long way since the browser wars** of the late 90s.
  What used to be a struggle,
  is now often a breeze (see ``box-shadow`` or ``border-radius``).
  But the last 2 years have pushed CSS into entirely new territory:
  with DOM-aware variables
  and calculations that can drive your design,
  without all the invasive Javascript.
