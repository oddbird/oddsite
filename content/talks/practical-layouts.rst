Join the creator of the `Susy`_ grid system
for a review of layout and grid techniques —
when to use them,
what to consider,
and how to roll your own layouts with minimum code.
We'll look at everything from floats to CSS Grid,
flexbox, and even custom properties —
and how to start using the new toys right away,
with only a few lines of code.

- When to use floats, CSS Grid, flexbox,
  custom properties, and other techniques.
- How to make grid-math simple, and lose the grid-system.
- How to make grid-systems work for you when you need them.
