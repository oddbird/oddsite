summary: |
  **Come along for a tour of Python's more advanced features:**
  decorators, context managers, descriptors,
  iterators, generators, and metaclasses.
  We'll look at several examples of each in real use,
  and understand the benefits the feature brings over other approaches.
  We'll also discuss what problems you might
  (or might not) want to reach for each of them as a solution to.
