summary: |
  *Style Guides & Pattern Libraries are great tools*
  for documenting the relationships between code and design,
  but beautiful docs are only half the battle.
  Behind the scenes those patterns have to live in our code,
  and make life easier for developers.
  Let's talk about how we build patterns in code,
  and how we can use them to automate our documentation
  keeping everything up-to-date
  without extensive maintenance.


Code Patterns for Pattern Making
================================

- Using pre-processors for pattern-making in CSS and HTML.
- Designing and integrating toolkits that force pattern-making.
- Examples of what we've done, where we've failed, and where we're headed.
