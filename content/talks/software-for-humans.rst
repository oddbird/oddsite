  A project-manager's reflections
  on **human-centered problem-solving**,
  client communication,
  and agile web development.
summary: |
  **The web is more than a technology platform**,
  it was created with a mission statement.
  Design and code trends also come with attached philosophies,
  and we need to consider the implications.
  We'll talk about our human-centered approach to product-design –
  learning to understand user-feedback,
  designing for edge-cases,
  transparent client communication,
  and tightly integrated design and development teams.
