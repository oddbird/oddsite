  A project-manager's reflections
  on **human-centered problem-solving**,
  client communication,
  and agile web development.
summary: |
  Technology is only useful
  when it solves real problems for real people.
  We'll talk about our human-centered approach to product-design –
  learning to understand user-feedback,
  designing for edge-cases,
  transparent client communication,
  and tightly integrated design and development teams.

===================

- a brief overview of the “losing control” philosophy behind the web
- how we learn from users about needs they may not be able to articulate
- how we integrate developers and designers in tight feedback cycles
- how we talk to clients about design choices
