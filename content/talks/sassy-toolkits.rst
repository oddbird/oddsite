summary: |
  **The web is littered with opinionated CSS frameworks**
  that can rapidly back you into a corner.
  Now pre-processors like Sass
  have opened the door for more flexible toolkits,
  and a thriving open-source community.
  You don't need 3 million followers
  and your own clearfix to contribute â€”
  just a willingness to participate and learn.
  Together, we can build more flexible and powerful toolkits
  that respect our unique styles and constraints!
