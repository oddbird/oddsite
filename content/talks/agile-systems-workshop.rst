  Learn to **integrate design and code**
  to isolate components and
  automate style documentation
  with a **design system built for your needs**.
summary: |
  **Style Guides & Pattern Libraries are great tools**
  for documenting the relationships between code and design,
  but beautiful docs are only half the battle.
  A consistent system required consistent code,
  and integrated processes between designers & developers.
  We'll help you find ways to build patterns into our code,
  using templates and pre-processors to iterate and automate
  living design systems in an agile and integrated process?

======================

- Using templates and pre-processors for pattern-making in CSS and HTML.
- Designing and integrating toolkits that force pattern-making.
- Examples of what we've done, where we've failed, and where we're headed.
