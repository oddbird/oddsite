  An overview
  of the new features in CSS â€“
  from **Grid layout** to **typography**.
summary: |
  **For far too long we've been forced to reuse layout patterns**
  that have worked in the past,
  creating a web full of sites that all look the same.
  Narrow timelines,
  browser support restrictions
  and lack of a true grid systems
  have led us to create work that is "good enough".


The Great State of Design
=========================

`Stacy`_ spent years exploring
how we can make the web a more unique space.
With some of the newer CSS techniques available,
we can start to make more creative designs.
CSS Grid Layout is on the horizon
and will play a major role in the design of our sites.
Finally having a true,
2 dimensional grid will give our layouts much more flexibility
and it is on us to explore the possibilities.
