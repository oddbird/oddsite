summary: |
  `Miriam`_
  (the creator of `Susy`_)
  will show you the history of web layout,
  how grid systems work,
  and practical tip to avoid using them.
  For those few cases where a grid really is required,
  we'll talk about the best ways to roll your own,
  so you're not relying on a bloated library to make decisions for you.
  We'll also look at the new layout toys —
  from flexbox to CSS Grid —
  and how to get started with only a few lines of code.
