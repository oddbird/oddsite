summary: |
  **The web is more than a technology platform**,
  it was created with a mission statement,
  and a clear philosophy of inclusive diversity.
  One web, for everyone, from any device,
  with control in the hands of users.
  Design and code trends also come with attached philosophies --
  and they're not always so friendly.
  What do we even believe about diversity,
  and how is it reflected in our code,
  our companies, clients, products, and  processes?


User Un-Friendly
================

- How the medium influences what we make, and how we work.
- Understanding "open" and "opinionated" philosophies.
- What can art learn from design, and vice versa?
- Understanding (and seeking-out) user-feedback, without sacrificing vision.
