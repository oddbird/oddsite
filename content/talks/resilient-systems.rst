Resilient Web Systems
=====================

While the `1-day workshop <#@@@>`_
covers fundamentals for a wide range of attendees,
we can customize the material for internal team trainings.
Whether you work in Django, jQuery, React, Vue, or something else entirely -- 
we'll dig into your specific needs,
to find a process and architecture that works for you.
That can include a range of topics:

- Integrating design and development processes around a design system
- Organizing and packaging full HTML/CSS/JS component libraries
- Managing complex and user-customizable themes across applications
- Finding the tools and conventions that work best for your team
- Improving performance and accessibility with components


One-Day Package
---------------

Join Miriam for a deep-dive into the heart of the front end
with CSS fundamentals and best practice:
how it works, what makes it special, and how we can harness it
for resilient and maintainable design systems that scale.
Rather than learning a single convention or toolkit,
you'll learn what all the conventions share -- 
how to think with CSS, and make smart decisions for your own project:

- Why CSS works the way it does:
  from cascade and inheritance to normal flow and formatting contexts
- Modern and "intrinsic" web layout in-depth:
  putting flexbox, grid, floats, alignment, writing modes,
  media queries and display in context
- Moving past "browser support" to write modern and resilient CSS everywhere,
  to take advantage of new features
  without duplicating your efforts and driving up budgets
- The foundations of every CSS architecture and naming convention,
  from OOCSS to BEM, SMACSS, ITCSS and beyond
- Building meaningful and maintainable design systems with modern CSS and Sass
- Integrating documentation and cross-team communication
- Where CSS is going, and how you can get involved
