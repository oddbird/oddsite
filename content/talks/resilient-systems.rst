modules:
  - title: CSS Fundamentals In-Depth
    summary: |
      It's possible to write CSS for years
      without fully understanding
      the core features of the language:
      from the cascade & inheritance,
      to the declarative & contextual
      programming paradigm.
  - title: Resilient & Universal Code
    summary: |
      Browser support & device compatibility
      don't have to be difficult and expensive.
      We'll cover a number of techniques
      for building more resilient and universal
      front end code,
      while taking advantage of new browser features
      as they become available.
  - title: Intrinsic & Responsive Layouts
    summary: |
      We'll cover the web layout system as a whole --
      grids, flow, flexbox, alignment,
      intrinsic sizing, and queries --
      showing when and how to mix and match techniques
      for fast and dynamic layouts.
  - title: Naming & Organizing Conventions
    summary: |
      From OOCSS to ITCSS, SMACSS, BEM, and atomic design,
      there are a number of naming and organizing
      conventions that can help us write
      modular & maintainable CSS.
      We'll look at what these systems have in common,
      and how to adapt those principles for the needs
      of your team or project.
  - title: Design Systems & Component Libraries
    summary: |
      Reusable design & component systems
      can improve consistency,
      code-quality,
      and team communication.
      You don't need a dedicated team and budget
      to get started.
      We'll talk about planning and designing systems
      in an agile and integrated environment.
  - title: Style Guides & Documentation
    summary: |
      Documentation is central to maintainable code,
      but how do we make sure the documentation
      itself is maintained and up-to-date?
      We'll look at workflow and tooling
      for automated and integrated style guides
      and documentation.
  - title: Tooling & Testing
    summary: |
      The tools we use help define our workflow,
      and the long-term reliability of our code.
      Tools & tests should help encourage best-practice
      without locking us into antiquated systems.
      We'll talk about designing
      the right tooling and testing workflow
      for your team or project.
  - title: Team Process & Workflow
    summary: |
      Struggling with messy handoff
      or communication between designers & developers?
      We can help you find the
      practical workflows that keep your
      process running smoothly.
  - title: HTML & CSS in JS Frameworks
    summary: |
      With the proliferation of modern JavaScript frameworks,
      we need to rethink exactly how the
      core web languages relate and work together.
      With some thoughtful integration
      we can take advantage of all the new power
      in tools like React and Vue
      without losing sight of what HTML & CSS provide.
  - title: Sass Modules & Pre-Processing
    summary: |
      Sass has become one of the fundamental tools
      for writing clear & maintainable CSS,
      and is growing quickly
      with a new modular syntax,
      more powerful math,
      and new features landing regularly.
      We'll help you get the most out of
      everything Sass has to offer.
