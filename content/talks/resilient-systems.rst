modules:
  - title: Resilient & Universal Code
    summary: |
      Browser & device support
      don't have to be difficult and expensive.
      We'll cover a number of techniques
      for building more resilient and universal
      front end code,
      while taking advantage of new browser features
      as they become available.
  - title: Intrinsic & Responsive Layouts
    summary: |
      The web layout system has come a long way --
      with grids, flexbox, alignment,
      and intrinsic sizing.
      We'll cover the system as a whole,
      and when to use each technique
      to achieve dynamic & resilient layouts fast.
  - title: Naming & Organizing Conventions
    summary: |
      From OOCSS to ITCSS, SMACSS, BEM, and atomic design,
      there are a number of naming and organizing
      conventions that can help us write
      modular & maintainable CSS.
      We'll look at what these systems have in common,
      and how to mix-and-match for the needs
      of a particular team or project.
  - title: Design Systems & Component Libraries
    summary: |
      Reusable design & component systems
      can improve consistency,
      code-quality,
      and team communication.
      You don't need a dedicated team and budget
      to get started.
      We'll talk about planning and designing systems
      in an agile and integrated environment.
  - title: Style Guides & Documentation
    summary: |
      Documentation is central to maintainable code,
      but how do we make sure the documentation
      itself is maintained and up-to-date?
      We'll look at workflow and tooling
      for automated and integrated style guides
      and documentation.
  - title: Tooling & Testing
    summary: |
      The tools we use help define our workflow,
      and the long-term reliability of our code.
      Tools & tests should help encourage best-practice
      without locking us into antiquated systems.
      We'll talk about designing
      the right tooling and testing workflow
      for your team or project.
  - title: Team Process & Wokflow
    summary: |
      Struggling with messy handoff
      or communication between designers & developers?
      We can help you find the
      practical workflows that keep your
      process running smoothly
      to create beautiful & integrated user experiences.
  - title: HTML & CSS in JS Frameworks
    summary: |
      With the advent of JS frameworks,
      we need to rethink exactly how the there
      core web languages relate and work together.
      With some thoughtful integration
      we can take advantage of all the new power
      in tools like React and Vue
      without losing site of what HTML & CSS provide.
summary: |
  **Set your team & project up for long-term success**
  with an in-depth training on front end code and workflow --
  from advanced HTML/CSS
  to design systems, component libraries,
  responsive & intrinsic layouts,
  naming conventions, and documentation.


Resilient Web Systems
=====================

.. callmacro:: content.macros.j2#rst

  The web platform is designed to be universally
  accessible and resilient across a range of
  devices and interfaces.
  That presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities
  for our web applications.

  We offer 1-3 day workshops with ongoing consulting
  to help you take full advantage of the web,
  improve team process,
  and reduce maintenance over the long term.
