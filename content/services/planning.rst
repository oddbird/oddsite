      Your chance to provide a general sense of the goals, scope, and
      requirements of the project. We’ll work with you to gain an
      understanding of your users and the core features that define
      your web app.
  - title: 'Interactive Mockup'
    icon: 'mockup'
    text: |
      Beautiful designs of the application showing core features as defined
      in the Project Summary. Highly designed, interactive visualizations
      of your web app that represent the content layout and demonstrate
      basic features. Colors and fonts will be based on the existing brand
      or an accessible placeholder brand. (Full brand identity development
      process not included, but available upon request.)

  - title: 'Project Overview'
    icon: 'map'
    text: |
      Your chance to provide a general sense of the goals, scope, and
      requirements of the project. Much of the information may be available
      in planning documents you have already generated. This is a central
      reference to build from.
  - title: 'User Profiles'
    icon: 'users'
    text: |
      Imagine a day in the life of your user. When and where do they use your
      application? What activities does a user go through during a day.
      At what times and in what locations will they interact with your
      application?
  - title: 'User Stories'
    icon: 'theater'
    text: |
      A list of expected features, written as “stories” from the perspective
      of a single user. What are they trying to do, and why? The final list
      represents all of the ways that a user will interact with the
      application. The final development estimate will be itemized by story,
      making it easier to set your priorities and budget for each phase of the
      project.
  - title: 'Data Model/Glossary'
    icon: 'site-map'
    text: |
      What are the core concepts/objects around which the application is
      built? These will be the models. What are the relationships between
      the models? What data attributes does each model have, and what is
      the data-type for each attribute? Giving everything a name and
      describing the relationships will help guide development, and keep
      the entire team on the same page.
  - title: 'Interactive Wireframe'
    icon: 'interact'
    text: |
      A basic, interactive design of the application, showing the movement
      of users through core interactions defined in the User Stories. We’ll
      make it look good, but lo-fi and unbranded, including several linked
      gray-scale pages. Perfect for a proof-of-concept for generating
      board-member, stakeholder, or investor buy-in. This will also be
      useful for a development team to kick-start the full production
      process when you take that next step.
  - title: 'Design/Development Estimate'
    icon: 'estimate'
    text: |
      We’ll estimate each User Story individually, providing you with an
      itemized estimate, organized into phases when appropriate. We’ll
      work with you to add, remove, and rearrange features to find the
      right balance of functionality and budget.
