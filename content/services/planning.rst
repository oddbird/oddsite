      Your chance to provide a general sense of the goals, scope, and

      understanding of your users and the core features that define
      your web app.

      Beautiful designs of the application showing core features as defined

      of your web app that represent the content layout and demonstrate
      basic features. Colors and fonts will be based on the existing brand
      or an accessible placeholder brand. (Full brand identity development
      process not included, but available upon request.)

  - title: 'Goals'
    icon: 'map'
    text: |
      Together we’ll discuss the goals, scope, and requirements of the
      project and create a map for our journey. Some of the information may
      be available in planning documents you have already created. This
      process includes a review of technical, brand, and marketing goals as
      needed. Below are a few sample questions.

      **What is the goal of the application?** |br|
      *In other words, when it’s done and working great, what specific outcomes will occur? Are we trying to close sales? Are we telling a story? Are we earning permission to follow up? Are we hoping that people will watch or learn?*

      **Who are we trying to reach?** |br|
      *Is it everyone? Existing customers? A certain kind of prospect? What are the existing apps and sites that this group has demonstrated they enjoy interacting with?*

      **Does your audience have specific accessibility needs? Basic accessibility is included.** |br|
      *Do varying ability levels play a role? Languages or other cultural/location differences? What web browsers and mobile devices do we hope to support?*

  - title: 'User Profiles'
    icon: 'users'
    text: |
      Next we will create User Profiles to help us imagine a day in the life
      of your users. When and where do they use the application? What are
      they trying to do on the tool, and why? Below is a sample excerpt from
      a User Profile.

      **User 1 - Coach** |br|
      In the morning, Sam sits down at her desk in her office and opens CoachHub on her desktop in Chrome browser. She skims the dashboard and notices two alerts — new customer signups — that she needs to respond to right away. She clicks on one customer name and is taken directly to their profile information. Sam quickly browses their list of needs and clicks on her calendar to confirm the meeting date the new customer requested. It is easy to continue to the next customer because the tool bar with alerts still appears at the top of this page. After taking care of the immediate tasks…

  - title: 'Interactive Wireframe'
    icon: 'interact'
    text: |
      We will also create a basic, interactive design of the application,
      showing the movement of users through core interactions. We’ll make it
      look good, but lo-fi and unbranded, including several linked gray-scale
      pages. Wireframes are a great way to start visualizing your web product
      or site — helping us get into the specifics of what your app should do.
      Wireframes are also a fantastic tool to get investor, CEO, or board
      approval.

  - title: 'User Stories'
    icon: 'theater'
    text: |
      Using the Goals, User Profiles, Interviews, and Wireframe we will
      create a list of expected features or “stories” written from the
      perspective of individuals. The final list of User Stories represents
      all the ways people will interact with the web application or site.
      User Stories help us provide an accurate estimate, and collaborate with
      you to prioritize tasks, keeping you in control of the cost. Below is a
      sample set of User Stories. Large projects can have over 100 Stories.

      **As a Coach, I want** to see a dashboard. |br|
      As a Coach, I want to check alerts. |br|
      As a Coach, I want to see and confirm appointments on a calendar. |br|
      As a Coach, I want to view a client’s profile with need requests.

      **As a Client, I want** to create a profile. |br|
      As a Client, I want to request an appointment on a calendar. |br|
      As a Client, I want to select specific services from a list.

      What are the core concepts/objects around which the application is
      built? These are the data models. What are the relationships between
      the models? What data attributes does each model have, and what is the
      data-type for each attribute? Giving everything a name and describing
      the relationships will help guide development, and keep the entire team
      on the same page.
  - title: 'Itemized & Prioritized Estimate'
    icon: 'estimate'
    text: |
      We’ll estimate each User Story individually, providing you with an
      itemized hourly estimate, organized into phases where appropriate.
      We’ll work with you to add, remove, and rearrange features to find the
      right balance of functionality and budget.

  - title: 'Competitor Overview'
    icon: 'running'
    text: |
      Let’s take a look at existing web apps and companies that serve a
      similar audience to get an overview of industry trends and potential
      pitfalls to avoid. We’ll do a more detailed analysis of a direct
      competitor, asking questions like “what are the specific features this
      competitor is using to serve people?” and “how comfortable do users
      feel when using this competitor’s web app?”
  - title: 'User Interviews'
    icon: 'messaging'
    text: |
      Because your digital product needs to serve different people with
      distinct needs, we would like to have direct conversations with a
      variety of users in order to create something they will all find
      useful. These interviews can happen over the phone, via video chat, or
      through an online survey.
summary: |
  **Most projects start with Research & Concepting**
  to make sure we thoroughly understand your project.
  We’ll help you pinpoint the right digital product –
  a combination of customer/user needs and business goals –
  with a robust plan for development and launch.
  We’ll create an interactive wireframe to visualize
  your application or website,
  and a prioritized estimate to keep you in control of cost.
