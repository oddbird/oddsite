Susy Next: The Second Alpha
===========================

I've just released the `second alpha`_ of Susy Next.
Go download and play with it!

The main difference you will notice from Susy 1.0
is a "natural-language" syntax
that allows you to adjust settings more quickly and easily
on the fly.
You can also go gridless,
and we'll still help you manage your layouts.

We haven't written full docs yet,
and this blog post will be vastly incomplete,
but I'll give you a quick rundown of where we're going.
This is all open to change, of course.
There's a reason we're still in alpha.

Span Anything
-------------

The main layout mixin is called ``span``
and allows you to span columns on a grid,
or span any width you want,
and forget about grids entirely.

.. code:: scss

  // span 50%
  @include span(50%);

  // span 300px;
  @include span(300px);

  // span 3 columns
  @include span(3);

  // span 4 of 12 columns
  @include span(4 of 12);

  // span the last 3 columns in a 5-column row
  @include span(last 3 of 5);

  // isolate an item in the last 3 columns of a 5-column row
  @include span(last 3 of 5 isolate);

  // isolate 2-col width, in the 3rd of 12 columns
  @include span(2 at 3 of 12);

  // anything can be arbitrary: width (30em), gutter (20px), & location (30%)!
  @include span(isolate 30em gutter 20px at 30%);

You can also use various keywords to change your output from the defaults.
Output ``static`` or ``fluid`` units;
move gutters ``before``, ``after``, ``split``, or ``inside``;
``isolate`` or ``float`` elements;
and so on.

Establishing Grids
------------------

In Susy 2.0,
you still can set individual settings,
but you can also contain an entire grid in a single argument.
That allows us to change grids easily:

.. code:: scss

  $container: 80%;
  $columns: 12;
  $gutters: 1/4;
  $gutter-placement: before;

  // or:

  @include set-grid(80% 12 1/4 before);

Let's dissect that.

- A grid starts with an optional container-width,
  similar to the Susy 1.0 ``$container-width`` setting —
  in this case ``80%``.
- After that we have columns,
  which can either be a simple number for symmetrical grids
  (in this case ``12``)
  or a list of relative column sizes:
  ``(1 2 3.5 2)`` would create 4 columns of unequal size.
- Then gutters are passed as a simple fraction -
  ``1/4`` of a column for us.
  If you want to establish column/gutter widths
  as you did in Susy 1.0,
  you can pass your ratio as a list of two values —
  ``(4em 1em)`` —
  and we'll use those values as column and gutter widths.
- Finally you can pass a number of optional keyword settings,
  such as ``before``, ``after``, ``split``, and ``inside``
  to change how we handle gutters;
  ``static`` or ``fluid`` to use either fixed or relative widths;
  and ``float`` or ``isolate`` to establish your default positioning.

Here are a few grids:

.. code:: scss

  $susy-1-default: 12 (4em 1em) after;
  $960-ish: 12 (60px 20px) inside static;
  $asymmetrical: (2 8 2) 1/3 isolate;

  // set a grid globally
  @include set-grid($susy-1-default);

  // use a grid locally
  @include use-grid($960-ish) {
    /* This code will use the $960-ish grid... */
  }

You can use ``set-grid()`` to establish new grids anywhere you need,
or ``use-grid() { ... }`` to use a new grid for one block of code.

As you can see,
we're trying to make the system as flexible as possible,
so you can create the layouts that work for you.

Containers and Grid Backgrounds
-------------------------------

Containers are simple with the ``container`` mixin,
and the grid syntax you already learned.

.. code:: scss

  @include container($grid);

Of course, we'll default to any grid you already set globally.
you can also pass an arbitrary width,
or add keywords to justify your container ``left``, ``right``, or ``center``.

.. code:: scss

  // 960 container, justified left
  @include container(960px left);

While you're at it,
you can ``show`` or ``hide`` the grid background
for that particular container:

.. code:: scss

  @include container(show);

Galleries (formerly "isolate-grid")
-----------------------------------

You can now create a simple gallery layout
using either isolation or basic float techniques.
The syntax should be familiar already:

.. code:: scss

  @include gallery(2 of 12 isolate);

Media Queries
-------------

Media-query handling hasn't been built in yet.
We recommend that you use the brilliant
`breakpoint`_ plugin by Mason Wendell.
We'll add a bit of integration in before 2.0 stable,
but for now you can just add the `use-grid()` mixin
inside any media-queries to change your grids:

.. code:: scss

  // using breakpoint
  @include breakpoint(50em) {
    @include use-grid($my-grid) {
      /* Your Code Here */
    }
  }
