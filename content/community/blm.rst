  **OddBird stands with the Black community
  in grieving and protesting racist police violence and murder.**
  We must all demand an end to
  the state-sanctioned assault on Black people,
  and take action to confront
  anti-Blackness in all our systems.
  There is much to do, but one action is simple and clear:
  we want to support the organizations
  already working in the streets and behind the scenes --
  and **we're inviting you to join us**.

      #BlackLivesMatter was founded in 2013
      in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martinâ€™s murderer.
      Their mission is to eradicate white supremacy
      and build local power to intervene in violence
      inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.
      We'll match direct donations to BLM
      or anyone they list on their donation page.

  Neutrality is Not an Option
  ---------------------------

  We understand that software is political,
  tech is complicit,
  and anti-Blackness is systemic to our nation and our industry.
  We'll continue to fight for diversity & inclusion in our communities,
  in our work, and in our own company --
  from training & hiring, to equal pay,
  speaking opportunities, mentorship,
  decision-making, and shared ownership.

  **We are not neutral.**
