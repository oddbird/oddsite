summary: |
  **We love being part of
  a vibrant web design and development community.**
  We benefit daily from the generous contributions of others,
  and believe that a `diverse network`_ of shared experiences and ideas
  makes all of our work stronger.
  In addition to our `open source software`_ and `public speaking`_,
  we are proud to sponsor
  organizations that increase diversity in the community –
  from race and gender, to identity and sexuality –
  and events that bring the whole community together
  in thoughtful and inclusive ways.
  And then, on occasion,
  we also sponsor the communities and events
  that keep us entertained and fulfilled outside of work.
