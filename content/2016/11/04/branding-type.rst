Behind the Scenes: OddSite Brand Process
========================================

What follows is an in-depth look at our brand design process thus far as we
work towards a new look and feel for this, our OddSite. Details, confessions,
what worked, what flopped, and why.

If you make it all the way through to the end, we’re hoping you’ll give us your
opinions on an important question. (Go ahead. Scroll to the end. We’ll wait
here.)


Where We Began
--------------

In the spring of this year at our bi-annual work retreat, OddBird decided to
grow our company to six people. In order to grow, we needed a website that
would more clearly articulate our design process and development services to
potential clients. After `Defining Goals and Exploring Possibilities`_ we
identified the people we’d like to reach with OddSite – entrepreneurs with new
software ideas and other web developers in our community – and decided that an
open website redesign process would be one way to inspire and engage those
users. In reality we’ve been moving slowly, distracted by client work. We’ll
keep giving it as much attention as we can!

First, we mapped out a content flow, so Miriam and Stacy could build the basic
site architecture that you see now. Next, we needed a brand. Little did we know
the struggles we would encounter, the rag-clad wizards who would point the way
out of the thicket, or the new tools we would gain for our questing satchels…
(I’m in the middle of writing a fantasy novel. My apologies.)

An Odd Logo
-----------

In 2008 when OddBird launched, Miriam designed the OddBird logo. It’s gone
through some small adjustments, but we still love our odd orange egg-wing
friend, so we’re sticking with it. The text behind the bird is up for grabs,
though, as we consider what typography best suits the overall site. More on
that below.


The Birds: Design Team
----------------------

`Miriam`_, `Sondra`_, and `Stacy`_ are the OddBird design team. Each of us
brought years of varied experience, methods, tools, and questions. This would
be Miriam’s and Sondra’s first time working on brand design with Stacy, and we
were all excited to get started!

Element Collages, Moodboards, and Style Tiles? Oh my!
-----------------------------------------------------


At our fall work retreat, the full OddBird team met with a business development
professional who helped us further clarify and confirm our brand goals. The
design team spent time individually looking at the brand elements of our
favorite websites and sites with similar goals. We came back together for a
show-and-tell, first among ourselves, and then with a brief overview of our
findings and ideas for the full team. That’s when we ran into a big question
about our process.

Do we create element collages, mood boards, or style tiles to take these
general brand ideas to the next stage? We each had successful experiences using
all of these methods to create brands for clients, and we went back and forth
about which one would work best for us.

**Mood Boards:**
A `mood board`_ is a collection of elements such as text, images, colors,
textures, and styles that convey a particular look and feel or mood for a web
project. Talking through several mood boards with a client can be an excellent
place to start when you need to pick a fairly general brand direction.

**Style Tiles:**

The genius of style tiles is the way they define a middle ground – more
specific than a mood board and more open for interpretation than a full mockup.
Samantha Warren wrote an excellent article for A List Apart called `Style Tiles
and How They Work`_.

**Element Collages:**
Element collages focus on brand design for a set of elements grouped together,
a form, for example. Element collages are quicker to design than full mockups,
but detailed enough to help a client visualize an implemented brand. Daniel
Mall goes into detail on `Element Collages`_ on his blog.

The design team struggled with which technique would be most useful for our
internal design process. There were too many elements to consider at once in
our element collages, and we were loath to use the blender method of mixing and
matching, but neither did we feel that any one element collage encapsulated our
brand. We tried style tiles, but those felt both too specific and not specific
enough.

Sometimes tools that worked before don't work for a new team or project.
Fortunately, we remembered that getting stuck isn't a failure. Good process
doesn't mean ideas always flow smoothly, without ever going down the wrong
path. Our goal isn't to foresee and avoid every problem, but to recognize when
we're getting stuck, and have the tools available to try a different approach.

So we looked to our community for inspiration. Stacy posted a fantastic article
from `Vox Product`_ detailing their brand design process. When their design
team got to the step we reached, they wisely picked a single element to focus
on: typography.

Typography - With a Little Help From Our Friends
------------------------------------------------

Our three designers each created several designs – basically element collages –
of a blogpost. We picked the blogpost for two reasons: it is text heavy, and it
is also the core of our new website design. We want to be an education source
for the web community, part of a conversation with you. Our blog is an
essential conversation starter, so it is important for us to design it well.
Focusing on just one element, typography, clarified the conversation, and we’ve
narrowed the selection to our top three typefaces.

During our conversations about typography so far, the design team settled on a
couple elements that fit our brand well.

**Break Rectangles:**
In all of our styles you’ll see us using text to create uneven or rounded
edges. By breaking the column in surprising, yet tasteful ways we aim to
express our oddness without being overly cute.

**Classic Serif:**
We like the classic look of the serif font for body text as it brings to mind
newspapers and books creating a timeless, almost tactile feel. We want to
convey honesty and thoughtfulness with our brand and classic serif fonts like
Baskerville are known for communicating trustworthiness.

And this is where you come in. We’re having a conversation on our `OddFriends
Slack channel`_, and we want to hear from you. There are other design elements,
but we are only interested here in choosing the new OddSite typeface. Please
weigh in with your opinions and thoughts and things you’ve learned the hard
way. If we didn’t know it before, this OddSite brand design process has proven
how dependent we are on each other to do this business of web design to the
best of our abilities. Thanks!
