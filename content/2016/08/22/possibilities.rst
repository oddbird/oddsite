Defining Goals, Exploring Possibilities
=======================================

This spring,
after roughly four years as CMO
at a health and wellness products manufacturer,
I said a bittersweet goodbye.
I was thrilled about the opportunity
to focus on user experience and graphic design at OddBird,
but I knew I would miss writing ad copy
and guiding marketing strategy.
Turns out,
I didn’t have long to pine.

OddBird met for a work retreat in April.
On the Oddgenda:
grow the company
and redesign OddSite.
I came home from retreat
tasked with reviewing OddBird’s web presence
and proposing ways to improve communication
about our process and services
in order to attract new clients.
Marketing! Woo!


Research
--------

I started with a Google search,
as many people do
when looking to hire a web development company.
Drawing inspiration from the websites of similar development agencies,
I audited OddBird’s current site
and web presence.
I read blog posts
with advice for clients
on how to hire a great web developer.
I collected feedback from past clients.
And I asked questions like “What makes OddBird odd?”
and “Should I buy a cappuccino or a latte at this cafe?”

Relying on this research and my past experiences,
I drafted a proposal for the team to review.
This feedback stage confirmed the proposed direction
and helped to clarify a core OddBird value —
*the people that make up our team
are the defining characteristic
of the OddBird brand*.


Site Map
--------

The site outline I created next —
showing the flow of users through the website —
pivots around our core value: people.
Each section of content on the new OddSite
will seek to introduce and highlight
our tight-knit team of individuals.
No matter where a user enters our website
we want to make it easy to get to know us and,
most importantly,
to start a conversation.

We’re process geeks at OddBird,
always trying to understand
*what we’re even doing anyway*
and do it better.
That’s another core value,
and part of why designing our new site in the
open appealed to us.
In our review of the site map
the team left one question unresolved
with the intention of exploring it during development:
should we weave our design and development process
into case studies of work for past clients
or give *process* a page of its own?
We haven’t settled on an answer yet,
and we’d love to `hear what you think`_.

User Profiles
-------------

   :alt: oddsite user profiles


I created user profiles next —
an audit of the goals, usage and behavior
of each user type —
to focus our content around their specific needs.
Many of our past clients have come to us via referral
from other web developers,
so we identified developers as a primary OddSite user.
This open design process fits naturally
into a strategy to attract fellow devs.
Consider yourself targeted!

Seriously, though,
OddBird is committed to active participation
in the open source web development community.
We plan to continue writing blog posts
about our processes
and the tools we use or create
to make this work easier.
We’ll continue supporting the community in myriad ways,
through `donations`_,
`sponsorships`_,
writing,
and `speaking`_.
And, just as you’ve reached out to us,
we’ll reach out to you
with client referrals
and project collaborations of all kinds.
We’ve created a new `public Slack chat`_
for just that,
and you can find us on `Twitter`_
or test out our shiny new `contact form`_.
See that contact link at the bottom of every page?
That’s intentional.
We want to be in conversation with you.

.. _sponsorships: /community/
.. _speaking: /speaking/

Another type of user we’d like to reach
is the individual or company
that has an exciting business idea
and needs a development agency
to build the web tools to make that idea happen.
Imagining a day in the life of this user —
fast-paced, focused, creative, mobile —
helped me identify key elements to include on OddSite.
We aim to be transparent about our process
and make it easy to find
case studies and quotes from past clients
so new clients know what to expect.


User Stories
------------

User tasks,
or stories,
that drive interactions on the site
flowed naturally out of my thinking about types of users.
User stories,
written from the perspective of a user,
describe user goals for a given task.
I wrote a set of stories in `Pivotal Tracker`_,
prioritized them and assigned each story to a team member.
These blog posts about our open design process
are top priority user stories for the OddSite project.
*Pop!* (The sound of my brain exploding.)

Visual Design
-------------

To give ourselves a basic structure
for the open design process
`Stacy`_ and `Miriam`_ implemented a prototype
based on the site map.
We included minimal visual design,
just enough to make the content readable.
I’ve started creating rough mockups
for specific stories in Pivotal Tracker.
At OddBird,
we don’t spend time creating pixel perfect static images.
We design drafts.
Through pairing and conversation,
we continue to improve the visual design
and user experience
as it moves from a static mockup
to the interactive and responsive web.

Banner
------

My final task
before launching our draft
was to design a simple banner
with an explanation of our open design process
and an invitation to get involved.
It turned out to be a bigger challenge than I anticipated
to make the angled design look great across devices,
a challenge Stacy was more than up to,
but I’ll let her tell that story.
And I'll be writing more detailed posts
in the weeks to come
about each stage of the process outlined here.
