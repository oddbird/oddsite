summary: |
  I did a `live Q&A at SitePoint`_
  back in August.
  We talked about
  customizing Susy for your needs,
  why you might not need a grid system,
  other tools I'm working on,
  and how to select or build your own toolkits.

  It was a wild two-hours
  of typing as fast as I could,
  and hoping to sound intelligent.
  Thanks for asking the questions!

SitePoint: Live Q&A with Miriam
===============================

I did a `live Q&A at SitePoint`_
back in August.
We talked about
customizing Susy for your needs,
why you might not need a grid system,
other tools I'm working on,
and how to select or build your own toolkits.

It was a wild two-hours
of typing as fast as I could,
and hoping to sound intelligent.
Thanks for asking the questions!

  To be clear:
  now that we have border-box sizing,
  grid math can be much simpler.
  Complex math is only required
  if you are using margin-based gutters.
  Move your gutters into padding,
  and the math is simple.
  That's why I don't use Susy
  (or any grid system)
  much any more.
  ``percentage(1/5)`` works great in Sass -
  and flexbox takes care of the rest.
