    title: Struggling with Design Systems?
summary: |
  CSS was designed to solve two important problems
  with design on the web:
  building systems that style massive projects with minimal code,
  and creating resilient designs
  that work across an ever-growing range of devices.
  Join Miriam for a deep-dive into the heart of CSS:
  how it works, what makes it special,
  and how we can harness it
  for resilient and maintainable design systems that scale.

    in resilient CSS architecture,
    design systems,
    and component libraries.
