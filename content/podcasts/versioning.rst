summary: |
  I joined `Tim Evko`_ and `M. David Green`_
  for their great new `SitePoint`_ podcast –
  `The Versioning Show`_.
  We discussed going from lurker to speaker,
  the importance of writing about what you’re learning,
  stumbling into fame,
  approaching new projects,
  and unit testing in Sass.
