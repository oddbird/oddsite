summary: |
  **Design systems streamline development, communication, and consistency** --
  but often rely on dedicated teams and extended budgets.
  We wanted a tool to create and maintain
  living style guides & pattern libraries
  in an agile process, and on a budget.
  `Herman`_ helps keep our development flow simple,
  and our UX consistent,
  as we iterate on patterns
  and scale over time.

  *Today we're launching Herman 1.0
  as a free, open source project
  for anyone to use and make contributions.*

Herman Style Guides
===================

I spent the week after Thanksgiving in San Francisco,
attending (and `accidentally speaking at`_)
`Clarity`_ --
a "`Design Systems`_" conference
organized by the wonderful `Jina Anne`_.
If you don't have experience with design systems,
I highly recommend the `Handbook`_
which Jina co-authored --
available free online.

I'm always curious how many attendees at a conference
are working on enterprise projects
over a long period of time
vs. those of us who do consulting
for multiple clients each year.
These different contexts can lead to very different solutions --
affecting team size, budget, process, architecture,
and technical requirements.

I don't know the exact mix at Clarity,
but I think that design systems generally
skew towards the enterprise projects for one reason: budget.
Creating the beautiful `Salesforce Lightning Design System`_
requires an ongoing full-time dedicated team.
Those of us doing agency work don't often have that luxury,
but our clients still need a system that will work for them.

.. _Salesforce Lightning Design System: https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/

So how can we make design systems part of an agile process --
growing slowly along-side the application,
the same way we write and maintain test-coverage
as part of any project?
How do we make documentation and design consistency
the path of least resistance?

    **If it's not documented, it doesn't exist.**
    Documentation should become the default --
    an integrated part of the development process.

Design Systems can include a wide array of features,
more than just a pattern library,
and Herman does not cover the full gamut --
but it doesn't have to.
With `Herman`_ we start small,
documenting brand design tokens --
`colors`_, `fonts`_, `sizes`_, `ratios`_, and `icons`_ --
before expanding into `practical patterns and components`_,
with automation to help us scale.

Shared Problems, Unique Constraints
-----------------------------------

The term "design system" refers generally
to documenting & distributing
isolated patterns and components
that can be used across one or more applications
for consistent user experience.
That usually involves some combination of
"style guides" and/or "pattern libraries" --
the detailed documentation of design tokens,
UI patterns, components, and overall system guidelines.

Lightning Design and other massive projects
can make this goal feel daunting,
but we've found it useful to build what we can,
as we go,
even when the results are incomplete by comparison.
These problems aren't all-or-nothing.
There is room for flexibility in our approaches,
from one project to the next.
The important question is *where can I start*
improving design communication, clarity, and consistency?

At OddBird, our first style guide attempts failed
because they required too much maintenance and attention.
So we scaled back to automating color-palettes,
and not much else.
Over time we've added support
for a wide array of features
integrating with our Sass tooling,
and Herman has evolved into a full-featured tool
for agile design systems.

Now we use Herman across a range of products,
from large client applications
to our own internal toolkits.
While there are a number of possible configuration options,
the initial setup can be streamlined
to make sense on even the smallest projects.
We've even used Herman to `begin documenting itself`_ --
from design language to components and API.

.. _begin documenting itself: /herman/docs/

The project is not complete --
and never will be --
but that's the point.
As time goes on,
we'll keep adding features
that allow our systems to become larger,
more complex, and more automated --
with support for additional languages.


Integrated Syntax, Built on SassDoc
-----------------------------------

Style documentation tools
have existed for some time,
providing a great place to start
without re-inventing the wheel.
As a design-driven team using Sass/CSS,
we love keeping our style documentation
directly in with our stylesheets,
using tools like `KSS`_ and `SassDoc`_.
When developers add a pattern in the stylesheet,
they can document their work right at the source.
When a pattern changes,
all the edits can be made in a single location,
so documentation is more likely to stay up-to-date.

.. _KSS: http://warpspire.com/kss/
.. _SassDoc: http://sassdoc.com/

.. image:: /static/images/blog/2017/herman-intro/sassdoc.jpg
   :alt: SassDoc screenshot
   :class: extend-small img-border img-shadow
   :target: http://sassdoc.com/

Those tools are great,
but neither one is built to handle more complex design systems,
integrated with markup templates and other languages.
On the other side,
many of the existing "style guide generators"
are too intrinsically tied to specific JavaScript frameworks,
separating documentation and styles.
That may be a good solution for some,
but it didn't feel right for the way we work.

We decided to extend SassDoc,
using their framework as a jumping-off point for something larger.
The SassDoc syntax uses a variant on Sass line-comments
to explicitly mark documentation for parsing:

.. code:: scss

    // Normal Sass comments are ignored by SassDoc

    /// Comments that begin with 3 slashes
    /// will be parsed as SassDoc documentation.

In addition to allowing prose descriptions
(parsed as markdown),
SassDoc includes a number of explicit annotations,
using an ``@annotation`` syntax.
Here are just a few of their options:

.. code:: scss

    /// @group buttons
    /// @access public
    /// @param {color} $color [green] - The background color for the button
    /// @example scss
    ///   .button {
    ///     @include call-to-action(red);
    ///   }

Herman supports `all SassDoc annotations`_,
and we've added style guide features of our ownâ€¦

.. _all SassDoc annotations: http://sassdoc.com/annotations/


Visualizing Design Tokens
-------------------------

A "design token" is an abstract bit of design language
that normally becomes visible only when applied to
more explicit patterns and components.
Colors, fonts, scales, and grid-configurations
act as "sub-atomic" aspects of a design system --
often stemming directly from the brand,
before any UI components have been built.
This is a good place to start defining your system,
and Herman can help you visualize these abstractions.

Herman provides display annotations for `colors`_ (``@colors``),
`fonts`_ (``@fonts``), `sizes`_ (``@sizes``), and `ratios`_ (``@ratios``):

.. code:: scss

  /// @colors brand-primaries
  /// @font my-font (normal, bold)
  ///   <any html head required for CDN font imports>
  /// @sizes my-spacing
  /// @ratios my-modular-scale

.. image:: /static/images/blog/2017/herman-intro/colors.jpg
   :alt: Herman color palettes
   :class: extend-large img-border img-shadow img-spacing
   :target: /herman/docs/demo_colors.html

.. image:: /static/images/blog/2017/herman-intro/sizes.jpg
   :alt: Herman size palettes
   :class: extend-small img-border img-shadow
   :target: /herman/docs/demo_sizes.html

In order to display that data,
you will need to export all your Sass tokens to json,
using our provided `Sass export utilities`_.
We're working to make this step even more simple and automatic.

.. _Sass export utilities: /herman/docs/api_json-export.html


We also provide an ``@icons`` annotation
to display all the SVG icons in a given folder:

.. code:: scss

  /// @icons path-to/my-assets/svg/

.. image:: /static/images/blog/2017/herman-intro/icons.jpg
   :alt: Herman icon palettes
   :class: extend-small img-border img-shadow
   :target: /herman/docs/demo_icons.html


Rendered Output & Examples
--------------------------

At the pattern level,
we include more robust tools
for rendering code examples and live patterns.
While SassDoc only documents Sass abstractions,
Herman allows
`documentation of CSS selectors and markup patterns`_.

.. _documentation of CSS selectors and markup patterns: /herman/docs/demo_examples.html

We've extended SassDoc's ``@example`` annotation
for languages like `Sass`_ and `Nunjucks`_
(we're working on support for Vue components).
Herman will display both input and compiled code,
along with the rendered output when necessary:

.. _Sass: http://sass-lang.com
.. _Nunjucks: https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/

.. code:: scss

    /// Add default button styles to an element.
    /// @group buttons
    /// @example html - submit button
    ///   {% import 'content.macros.j2' as content %}
    ///   {{ content.button('Submit', attrs={'type': 'submit'}) }}
    [data-btn] {
      border: 1px solid currentColor;
      border-radius: 3em;
      color: pink;
      display: inline-block;
      padding: 0.25em 1em;
    }

.. image:: /static/images/blog/2017/herman-intro/examples.jpg
   :alt: Herman rendered example
   :class: extend-small img-border img-shadow
   :target: /herman/docs/demo_examples.html


Prose, Pages, and Third-Party Links
-----------------------------------

In building documentation --
from basic reference docs to extensive design systems --
we often find it useful to include additional prose
and links to third-party docs for dependencies.
There are several ways to do this in Herman:


Free-floating Prose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any SassDoc comments (``///``)
that are not attached to a specific
Sass/CSS objects will appear as free-floating prose,
and can be given generic annotations --
such as ``@group``, ``@example``, ``@link``, etc. --
including the Herman design-token annotations.


Additional Markdown Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add any number of `markdown documents`_
to your style guide navigation,
by defining ``extraDocs`` in your `Herman configuration`_.
We use this to create an introduction to our design systems,
provide quick access to a changelog,
or document patterns that are not directly attached to Sass code.

.. _markdown documents: /herman/docs/CONFIGURATION.html#extradocs
.. _Herman configuration: /herman/docs/CONFIGURATION.html


Third-party Links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also add `external links`_
to third-party dependencies -
so all relevant documentation is accessible in one place.
Define ``extraLinks`` in your Herman configuration,
and we'll add links to the bottom of the sidebar.

.. _external links: /herman/docs/CONFIGURATION.html#extralinks
