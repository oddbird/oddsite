      Talk: `Agile Design Systems in Vue`_

      .. _Agile Design Systems in Vue: /talks/agile-systems/
author: miriam
summary: |
  I've been excited about `Vue.JS`_
  since `Sarah Drasner`_ first showed me the basics.
  Since then,
  we've started using it for client work at OddBird,
  and I'm constantly impressed by the power and simplicity --
  so it was a real honor being invited to speak
  at the first `VueConf US`_, in New Orleans.

I enjoyed the conference as much as I enjoy the framework.
I was particularly impressed with the way core team members
talk about community and future development.
Everyone was welcoming,
interested in my contributions,
and helpful when I had questions.
Several of the core team members are now helping us
build Vue component documentation into `Herman`_,
our style guide generator.

I was also able to attend Sarah's
full-day Vue annimation workshop.
If you ever have the chance to learn from Sarah,
I highly recommned it.
I was already using the Vue
``<transition>`` and ``<transition-group>``
`built-in functionality`_ on projects,
but not to their full expent.
Revisiting an internal OddBird project
(still in early development)
I was finally able to create the page transitions
that I wanted all along.
The image is low-resolution
in order to show more animations,
without a massive file sizeâ€¦
