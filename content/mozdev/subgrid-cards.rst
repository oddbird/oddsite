summary: |
  Card layouts are popular on the web --
  rows and columns of boxes with similar content.
  CSS grids can help align those cards,
  but it's still hard to line up content inside the cards --
  headers and footers that might need more or less room.


Subgrid for Better Card Layouts
===============================

That's why we need "subgrid" --
coming in Firefox 71 (Dec 3)
and available now in Firefox Nightly.
This is a great opportunity to
quickly enhance our designs for modern browsers,
without losing anything in the browsers lacking subgrid support.
