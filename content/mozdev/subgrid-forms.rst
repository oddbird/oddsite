summary: |
  It's a common pattern to align form labels and inputs in grid-like layout.
  I'll show you how to do it quickly using CSS subgrid,
  with several quick fallbacks.


Laying out Forms using Subgrid
==============================

Subgrid will be available in Firefox 71 (Dec 3),
and you can use it already in Firefox Nightly --
but there's no need to wait.
Subgrid works great as a quick enhancement on top of your existing layouts!
