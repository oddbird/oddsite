summary: |
  Have you ever wanted to create more interesting shapes on the web,
  or flow text around the details of an image?
  Shape paths can be hard to code without a visual reference,
  but Firefox provides a shape editor to make it quick and clear.


Edit your CSS Shapes with the Shape Path Editor
===============================================

CSS provides a number of built-in shapes we can use --
from inset boxes to circles, ellipses, and polygons.
I'll show you how to use the tool to inspect, edit,
and create shapes directly in the browser.
