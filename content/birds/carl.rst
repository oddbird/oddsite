summary: |
  **Carl is an active owner and developer-emeritus**,
  providing oversight and counsel
  to the development team.
  He is a core developer of the `Django`_ Python web framework,
  an elected member of the inaugural `Django technical board`_,
  former maintainer of the widely-used `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_
  package management tools,
  co-author of multiple accepted
  enhancements to the Python language and ecosystem,
  and a Fellow of the `Python Software Foundation`_.
  When not chasing more elegant algorithms,
  he chases frisbees, hockey pucks, and a pair of sons.
