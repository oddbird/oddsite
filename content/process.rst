Client Process Checklist
========================

  Welcome, OddClient!

.. wrap:: p
  :class: intro-text

  Here we are, ready to build a sweet new web-thingy. It can be a daunting process, but the following steps have always led us to a product we love. Read through the steps to find out where we’re headed, or check back to see what we’ve done, and what comes next.

.. wrap:: div
  :class: problem

  .. wrap:: h2
    :class: header

    Step 1: Defining the problem.

  .. wrap:: div
    :class: wrap

    Every tool, application, or website exists to solve a set of problems for your business and your users. Our first task is to define those problems in detail. This will guide the rest of the process, and keep us focused on the primary concerns: your **users’ needs**, and your **business objectives**.

    We’re likely to review work you’ve already done, to get ourselves up to speed, work out all the important details, and make sure we all agree on the goals. Fight the urge to jump to solutions or copy solutions from someone else. State the problem first, and we’ll help find the best solution with the tools available.

  .. wrap:: ol
    :class: wrap

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-1

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **User Profiles**: *Who are the users?*

      Imagine a day in the life of your user. When and where do they use your application? Annotate the activities a user goes through during a day. Make note of the times and locations where they interact with your app. Does your user want to use it? What are their reasons for using the application. Are they rewarded or punished? Are the motivations internal or external?

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-2

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Data Models**: *What is the data?*

      What are the core concepts/objects around which the site is built? These will be the models. Name each one carefully and intentionally. Establishing a clear vocabulary allows us to communicate effectively about the project. What are the relationships between the models? What data attributes does each model have? What is the datatype of each attribute?

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-3

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **User Stories**: *What do the users need to accomplish with the data?*

      For each user, create stories that capture the various ways that user will need to use the app. What are all the various ways that a user will interact with the application? What will you (or your team) need to be able to do to maintain the app?

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-4

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Requirements**: *What factors affect that interaction?*

      Will the application need to be universally accessible? Do issues of disability play a role? What languages and browsers will the app need to support? Will the app be used regularly on mobile devices? What time of day and under what conditions?

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-5

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Phases**: *What are the priorities? What is the minimum needed for a useful launch?*

      Prioritize the user stories for the project, and divide the project into phases. Ensure that at the end of each phase, you have a functional, useful, launch-able product.

.. wrap:: div
  :class: solution

  .. wrap:: h2
    :class: header

    Step 2: Proposing a solution.

  .. wrap:: div
    :class: wrap

    Once the problem is well defined, we can start exploring possible solutions. Once there’s a plan in place, we’ll tell you how much time and money we think it will take, and work with you to adjust the scope and features to fit your schedule and budget.

  .. wrap:: ol
    :class: wrap

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-1

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Site Map**: *How might we organize the data? What pages are needed?*

      Based on the user stories for Phase 1, create a page hierarchy that defines the site content structure and taxonomy.

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-2

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Content Templates**: *What must each page accomplish?*

      For each page in the sitemap, think about the purpose (why is a user on this page?) and priority (what is most important on this page?). Include the page title, a short description of each item on the page, what each must do, what format it should be in, and a sample of each.

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-3

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Quote**: *What will it cost to build?*

      We’ll quote for launch-quality, and we’ll provide detailed line-items, so you can prioritize features to fit within your budget.

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-4

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Contract**

.. wrap:: div
  :class: implementation

  .. wrap:: h2
    :class: header

    Step 3: Implementing the solution.

  .. wrap:: div
    :class: wrap

    By this point we should all know why we’re here, the problems to be solved, and the proposed solutions. The actual development will follow a very collaborative and agile process, taking each feature through a series of stages - prototyping, testing, adding functionality, adjusting, etc, with `feedback at each stage`_. Once we have everything working, we’ll come back with a more artistic eye and give it a nice paint job.

    Our process is agile because the web is agile, and we often find unexpected problems and solutions as we go. Unlike some media, the web can be changed at any time. Making a decision now doesn’t need to be a matter of life and death. If you don’t like something, it can easily be changed.

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-1

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Prototype Wireframe**: *How will the user interact with the data?*

      Create an interactive, non-functional HTML mock-up of each page, including all the expected content. Pay particular attention to the purpose of each page, anticipating future user interface requirements.

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-2

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Functional Wireframe**: *Add the desired functionality.*

      Implement the features on each page, tidying up the layout and user interface as necessary.

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-3

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Style Tiles**: *How should it look and feel?*

      Collect existing brand collateral and create samples of typography, colors, textures, etc., resulting in a basic style-guide to work from.

    .. wrap:: li
      :class: step-4

      .. wrap:: h3
        :class: header

        **Design**: *Add the desired styling.*

      Make it look good!
