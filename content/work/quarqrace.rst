summary: |
  Quarq Race Intelligence captures and interprets
  race performance and state-of-play information,
  and delivers that data in real time to spectators,
  commentators, race officials,
  third-party analysis software and visualization tools.
  Integrating with Quarq's telemetry and reporting hardware,
  the app shows racers' positions, direction, speed, heart-rate,
  and a number of other statistics in real time.
  Our mobile-optimized web interface has been used for bicycle races,
  triathlons, and non-competitive events,
  including regular IronMan and Enduro races.
