      OddBird was quick to learn and pick up new technologies.
      They delivered high quality code, and delivered on time.

      When the inventor of the modern design system
      names you as the number one person she'd hire
      to build a design system, well then I jump!
      I'm grateful she put us in contact.

      It was easy to talk about technology options.
      OddBird was both flexible
      (working within the constraints of our existing systems)
      and opinionated
      (bringing context from past experience).

      I appreciated the specific experience OddBird brought to bear
      in terms of building component libraries,
      particularly the need to incrementally import the component library
      in order to have it successfully be used.

  Second Measure provides
  a daily view into company performance
  & consumer behavior data.
  We were hired to help
  organize the code and design systems
  into a reusable and fully documented
  React component library
  and integrated design system.
