      The internet was useless in deciding who to hire,
      with too much conflicting info.
      Then I found OddBird,
      providing **a focused team
      with a wide range of talent.**

      When we were close to testing with actual users,
      I started to panic.
      But Miriam asked “what do you need?”
      and then we built that, and it worked.

      OddBird already had so many processes
      in place as a team
      and knew how to work together;
      that allowed us get to where we are now.
