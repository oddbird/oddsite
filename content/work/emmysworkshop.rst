      The first meeting I had with `Miriam`_ helped me decide.
      **She was excited about the project but also realistic**
      about potential issues with the codebase.

summary: |
  Emmy's Workshop is part of a research project
  on how to improve computer-based educational systems
  that can accurately diagnoses learners' knowledge
  and recognize what misunderstandings a learner may have.
  In the tutor, learners can work through an entire problem
  before recieving feedback.
  This simulates the way a learner
  would work through a problem without the computer.
  Mathematical algorithms analyze how the problem was solved,
  and estimate how well the learner understands
  a variety of mathematical skills.
  The algorithms are relatively general,
  so they can be applied to a variety of computer-based educational tasks,
  such as games or virtual labs.
