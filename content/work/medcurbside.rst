      Other developers build exactly what you say,
      or they don’t understand,
      and develop the wrong thing.
      **OddBird always thinks about the project goals.**
      I defer to the team expertise now,
      which makes a better result.

      I liked the way OddBird presented themselves.
      **They were curious and asked detailed questions
      to really understand what was needed.**

summary: |
  MedCurbside was started by practicing physicians
  who want a more modern way
  to connect with good literature
  and the clinical knowledge in the healthcare community.
  The site helps clinicians exchange
  questions and answers with other clinicians –
  connecting visitors with evidence,
  facilitating quick progression from question to answer,
  curating the best content through community input,
  and generally helping clinicians deal with
  the plethora of information available in healthcare today.
