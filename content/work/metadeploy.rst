      Working with OddBird was
      **the best outsourcing experience I've ever had.**
      It didn't feel like outsourcing at all.
      **OddBird became an extension of our team**
      bringing UX, frontend, and backend brilliance
      to take MetaDeploy from an idea into a production application.

summary: |
  MetaDeploy helps nonprofit Salesforce admins and developers
  configure, install, and test
  packaged products --
  providing a graphic web interface
  for tasks and flows
  previously handled in the command-line.
  Admins can select from available products
  like the Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP)
  or Education Data Architecture (EDA),
  to install on one of their Salesforce organizations.
  MetaDeploy helps make packages easy to find,
  while allowing users to customize their installations,
  and run preflight checks
  before committing to a full install.
