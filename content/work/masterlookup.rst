summary: |
  With custom interactive in-browser maps,
  MLT streamlines the Providence Plan staff's task
  of mapping street addresses to deeded land parcels.
  In addition to allowing batch imports
  of large numbers of addresses from CSV files
  recording user-selected associations between addresses and parcels,
  MLT records an audit trail of all data changes
  and allows one-click rollback of any change.
  We worked closely with ProvPlan staff
  to ensure the tool was easy to understand,
  efficient, beautiful, and a pleasure to work with.
  MLT also includes a RESTful JSON API
  for querying address mapping data.
