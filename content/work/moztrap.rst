summary: |
  Mozilla's next-generation test case management system,
  MozTrap manages extensive test suites
  for all of Mozilla's software products
  (including Firefox, Thunderbird, Firefox OS, and others),
  and allows community testers from around the world
  to run tests on their system and report results back to Mozilla,
  which MozTrap aggregates into reports for product managers.
  MozTrap also includes a RESTful JSON API
  to allow automated tools to run tests and report results.
