summary: |
  **Susy 3.0** will be released in the next week,
  if all goes well,
  and there's a lot to write about it.
  I wanted to start with a detailed overview
  of one core concept: **spread**.


Understanding ``Spread`` in Susy3
=================================

Spread isn't new to Susy3,
`or even to Susy generally`_,
but its full power is usually hidden behind
other settings (like ``gutter-position`` in Susy2),
or opinionated assumptions about your grid.
We didn't invent the idea behind spread –
every grid system has to make these decisions –
but we haven't seen anyone else talking about it explicitly.

In Susy3 we've tried to move in the other direction –
naming spread, and making it central to the API –
giving you full control over the math.

Spread on Containers
--------------------

Container-spread describes how a grid-parent (or container)
handles available gutters.
Most grids only put gutters between the columns.
That means there will be one less gutter than there are columns.
We call that a ``narrow`` container-spread, and make it the default.

   :alt: container-spread: narrow
   :class: extend-small

Some grids use "split" gutters,
with half of a gutter on either side of a column –
forming full-gutters between columns,
and an extra half at the edges.
Mathematically, that means we have an equal number
of gutters and columns.
We call that a ``wide`` spread.

   :alt: container-spread: wide
   :class: extend-small

Occasionally, a grid will have full gutters on both sides,
meaning there is one more gutter than columns.
We call that a ``wider`` spread.

   :class: extend-small


Spread on Spans
---------------

Spread describes the same concept
as it relates to internal grid-spanning elements.
In most systems,
including the new `CSS Grid module`_,
all spans are ``narrow`` –
meaning they only span intermediate gutters.

.. image:: /static/images/blog/2017/spread/span-narrow.jpg
   :alt: spread: narrow
   :class: extend-small

Occasionally it's useful to span as many gutters as columns –
a ``wide`` spread –
if you have split-padding gutters, for example,
or if you want elements to touch at certain places,
or if you are pushing and pulling elements in the grid.

   :class: extend-small

It's rare that you need to span a ``wider`` spread,
but we'll let you decide if it's useful.

Fluid Context
-------------

In Susy3 there is no single grid "container" element
that receives special treatment.
Instead, container spans are described
in the same syntax as any other span –
and any element containing other grid-aligned elements
is a container.

Fluid-span calculations require understanding
both the container width and span-width.
The Sass math looks like this:

.. code:: scss

  $fluid-width: percentage($span-width / $container-width);

For that reason,
it's important to be explicit with Susy
about the spread of both containers and spans,
when you are building fluid grids.
In the Susy3 syntax, that looks like:

.. code:: scss

  $width: span(3 wide of 6 narrow);

If it comes before ``of``, it describes the span.
If it comes after ``of``, it describes the container.
In most cases,
there will be a sensible default for both values,
which you can set in the global settings:

.. code:: scss

  // Both default to "narrow"…
  $susy: (
    'spread': 'narrow',
    'container-spread': 'narrow',
  );



Common Use Cases
----------------

Commonly, all spans have a ``narrow`` spread.
In fact, the CSS Grid module doesn't provide any way
to span across extra gutters.
You would have to achieve a ``wide`` or ``wider`` span
using negative ``grid-gap``-sized margins.

There are times when you simply want to span across a gutter,
for the sake of style.
But there are other common reasons
to span extra gutters.
Let's look at a few.


Pushing, Pulling, & Padding Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's sometimes necessary to "push" and "pull" elements
out of their usual flow position,
or add grid-aligned padding.
You can do that by using the ``span`` functions
on the ``margin`` or ``padding`` of an element.
Push with positive left margins,
pull with negative right margins,
and pad either side with the padding property.

In all those cases,
you'll probably need a ``wide`` span
in order to align your content with the proper column:

|push|

.. |push| raw:: html

  <figure class="extend-small">
    <p data-height="480" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="BZjMXK" data-default-tab="result" data-user="mirisuzanne" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Susy3: Pushing and Pulling" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/mirisuzanne/pen/BZjMXK/">Susy3: Pushing & Pulling</a> by Miriam Suzanne (<a href="https://codepen.io/mirisuzanne">@mirisuzanne</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

  </figure>


Split Gutters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some grid systems use "split" gutters,
with half a gutter on either side of an element.
That will add an extra gutter to your total grid width,
giving your common ``container`` a ``wide`` spread.
If you are using split gutters,
you likely want to set ``container-spread: wide``
in your global settings.

Here's a ``wide`` container,
with ``narrow`` spans
and split gutters:

|split|

.. |split| raw:: html

  <figure class="extend-small">
    <p data-height="230" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="bREZWW" data-default-tab="result" data-user="mirisuzanne" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Susy3: Split Gutters" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/mirisuzanne/pen/bREZWW/">Susy3: Split Gutters</a> by Miriam Suzanne (<a href="https://codepen.io/mirisuzanne">@mirisuzanne</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
    <script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
  </figure>

If you move the gutters inside,
using the ``padding`` property,
both ``spread`` and ``container-spread`` may need to be ``wide``.
I say "may" because it also depends on your ``border-box-sizing``.
That's a whole new article,
and honestly:
padding gutters make the math much simpler.
If you use padding gutters,
there's a good chance you don't need Susy.

More about that in my next post.
Until then: Happy coding!
