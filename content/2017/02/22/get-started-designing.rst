  So you'd like to start learning design, but the number of tools and tutorials
  available is overwhelming. Where do you start? I recommend Paper for
  sketching out UX ideas, *Practice Code Theory for People Who Code* to
  generate color palettes and learn color theory, *Choosing the Right Font: A
  Practical Guide to Typography on the Web* as an introduction to typography,
  and Adobe Experience Design for UX prototyping.


Get Started with Design: 4 Useful Tools & Tutorials
===================================================

So you’re a developer or you’re brand new to the world of web design, and you’d
like to grow your design chops. How do you even begin to sort through the
overwhelming assortment of tools and tutorials available? In this guide, I’ll
introduce the tools I use daily in my work as a user experience and brand
designer for OddBird. I’ll recommend quick and useful tutorials that will get
you started designing right away.


Start Sketching: Paper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When tackling a complex UX design challenge, I start with sketches. My go-to
tool is aptly named `Paper`_. Paper, by 53, is free for iPad and iPhone. Paper
is much more basic than tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. In my
experience, a collapsable toolkit with several brush styles, seven colors, and
an eraser is all I need to sketch rough drafts of web features. Here are two
sample sketches I drew using Paper during the development of the `QuarqNet`_
web app.

With Paper, I can auto-straighten uneven lines and zoom in for detail work.
When drafting logos, I often trace images. Paper lets me upload an image, draw
on top of it, and easily delete the image from the background when I’m
finished.

Typography: A Practical Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to typography expert `Jason Santa Maria`_, “If your type is bad, the
design fails.” There’s so much to learn in the rich field of typography. To get
started, I recommend `Choosing the Right Font - A Practical Guide to Typography
on the Web`_ by Max Luzuriaga. Max provides an overview of important elements
to consider: readability, pairing, and size.

If you have an hour, check out `Jason Santa Maria On Web Typography`_, a talk
he presented at Build Conf 2011. Or delve into his book `On Web Typography`_,
but be warned – you may get bitten by the typography bug and find yourself
regaling your friends about that horrendous typeface pairing on the menu at
your favorite restaurant.

If you know the theory and you’re looking for free, high-quality typography for
your web project, here’s a list of `my favorite resources`_. You can also read
about the process I use to select typography for a brand identity.

Color: Sass Color Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It’s important for any designer to be able to create pleasing and accessible
color palettes. If you write code, `Natalya Shelburne’s Sass color functions`_
are an excellent tool for generating a palette that works. If you’re not a
developer, Natalya’s `Practical Color Theory for People Who Code`_ is still a
fantastic tutorial for how to think about color for the web. You’ll learn about
accessible contrast, using neutral colors, and how to simulate cohesive
lighting conditions.

Color can make or break a user’s experience on the web. If you’d like to learn
more, here's an outlined of my `process for choosing brand colors`_ including a
list of several fun and easy-to-use tools for generating color palettes and
testing contrast.

Prototype: Adobe Experience Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My new favorite UX design tool, `Adobe Experience Design`_, is still in beta.
Xd has a built-in tutorial that’s fun, beautiful, and takes less than an hour
to complete. I use Xd prototypes to flesh out my sketches, and to play with
colors, typography, and layout. Xd is also an excellent tool for working out
how users will flow through the content.
