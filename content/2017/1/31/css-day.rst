  CSS topics.


CSSDay 2016 Recap
=================

`CSS Day 2016`_ covered a wide range of topics for a one day conference
including SVG, animation, color theory, design, layout and more. Throughout the
day, a focus on code architecture was a theme. Attendees heard a few different
perspectives which were interesting to listen to and compare.

Below are the available videos and slides of each session, including two from
our very own OddBirds.

*(Several of the videos are currently missing from YouTube,
but we'll update the post when they become available.)*

Showing Gratitude
-----------------

The organizers and volunteers did a great job bringing the community together.

    Helping to plan CSSDay with my friends as a conference by developers, for
    developers, has been one of the most rewarding and exciting things that
    I've been able to do in my career. I’ve met so many amazing and talented
    people along the way. It has been an experience.

    --Brad Westfall

This was the second year `Brad Westfall`_ organized this event. We are very
thankful for conference organizers like Brad and his team, who post `videos`_
of the sessions, making this knowledge accessible for those who could not join
us live. `Photos`_ from CSSDay are also posted.

As always, we would love to discuss the content covered in these videos shared
