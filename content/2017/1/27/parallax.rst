Don'ts
~~~~~~

Paul, a developer at Google, starts with the don'ts. Don't use scroll events to
create a parallax effect.

  *"JavaScript doesn’t guarantee that parallaxing will
  keep in step with the page’s scroll position."*

Trying to achieve a parallax look by changing background position doesn't work
well either, negatively effecting the animation.

CSS 3D
~~~~~~

Paul recommends using CSS 3D for performant parallaxing, and gives detailed
instructions for how to do just that. Anticipating the bugs for us, Paul
includes various workarounds.
