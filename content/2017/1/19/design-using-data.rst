  Ongoing education in our industry is a must. Attending conferences is a
  great way to learn and network with other industry professionals.
  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to attend conferences but have no fear!
  Many of the best conferences post videos online giving our community an easy
  way to learn on our own time from anywhere in the world. Our first video in
  this series is a talk by Sarah Parmenter titled “Designing Using Data” given
  at An Event Apart Orlando.


Designing Using Data
====================

In her presentation, `Sarah Parmenter`_ walks us through a journey of using
research throughout the design process to make informed decisions. While she
is known for her work in user interface design, she goes beyond designing
screens and showcases how she created a successful (non-web design) business
by focusing on every detail of a customer’s experience.

I've personally struggled with accepting data at face value from tools like
analytics and a/b testing. While the raw data is reliable, the human
interpretation and organization of that data to provide meaningful insight is
where my hesitation begins. I've seen experts rely far too heavily on data
without considering the context of their visitor's situation, emotional state
and more. Sarah’s talk showcases how you can use both research and experience
to create the best results.
