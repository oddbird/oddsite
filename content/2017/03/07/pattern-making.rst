summary: |
  Living Style Guide documentation on the web
  is a difficult problem,
  gaining a lot of attention in the last few years.
  Let's take an in-depth look
  at one way to store patterns directly in Sass,
  and generate documentation automatically.


Code Patterns & Style Guides
============================

I've often been asked
how we sell style guides to our clients.
The short answer is: *we don't*.
Our clients want to put usable features
in front of real users
on a tight schedule.
Style guides aren't the product,
they're part of the process.

Style guides are necessary,
but keeping them alive
can be difficult and time-consuming.
We have to find ways
to integrate documentation into the daily workflow,
or it will get lost in the scramble
for bigger and better features.

As `Carl`_ likes to say:
*un-tested code is legacy code –
even if you wrote it an hour ago*.

.. _Carl: /authors/carl/

As I like to say:
*if you don't document something,
it doesn't exist*.

We've been struggling with these problems
for a long time,
and slowly developing a set of tools
to help us manage our patterns in code,
and document the results as we go.
We're not done,
but we've learned a lot,
and I'd like to show you what we have so far.


Starting Abstract
-----------------

The first style patterns we add
to any new project
(including this `OddSite design`_)
are color palettes, fonts,
and a typographic scale.
These are what I call "abstract" patterns –
conceptual rules that exist before
any element is ever styled on the page.

My first goal is to make these patterns
tangible in our code,
so they "exist" somehow
outside our own imaginations.
Our living style guide
(which will include colors, fonts, and sizes)
must be based on real and meaningful code,
or it's nothing but theory.

Grouping Variables into Maps
----------------------------

Lucky for us,
CSS pre-processors like Sass and Less
were invented to solve this problem.
It’s common
to store abstract patterns in Sass variables.
Here are some example variables from `Bootstrap-Sass`_,
where they define nearly `400 variables in a single file`_:

.. _Bootstrap-Sass: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass
.. _400 variables in a single file: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss

.. code:: scss

  // brand colors:
  $brand-primary:         darken(#428bca, 6.5%) !default; // #337ab7
  $brand-success:         #5cb85c !default;
  $brand-info:            #5bc0de !default;
  $brand-warning:         #f0ad4e !default;
  $brand-danger:          #d9534f !default;

  // applied colors:
  $link-color:            $brand-primary !default;
  $link-hover-color:      darken($link-color, 15%) !default;

  // font stacks:
  $font-family-sans-serif:  "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !default;
  $font-family-serif:       Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif !default;

  // font sizes:
  $font-size-base:          14px !default;
  $font-size-large:         ceil(($font-size-base * 1.25)) !default; // ~18px
  $font-size-small:         ceil(($font-size-base * 0.85)) !default; // ~12px

  // spacing sizes:
  $padding-base-vertical:     6px !default;
  $padding-base-horizontal:   12px !default;

There’s nothing wrong about that approach,
and it's certainly not unique to Bootstrap.
This is what variables are designed for,
and patterns defined this way are easy to access
without any help from a toolkit.

What’s missing is an explicit sense
of the patterns developing here:
brand-colors, link-colors, fonts, etc.
Variables are only related in implicit ways,
by giving them similar names.
We assume that ``$brand-primary``,
``$brand-success``, and ``$brand-info``
are part of the same pattern
because they look similar –
but that implicit relationship
relies on naming conventions,
code proximity,
and human interpretation.
Sass has no way of understanding
these relationships,
or automating style guides from them.

To address those issues,
we group all our common settings
into a few map variables.
If you haven’t used Sass Maps,
they are a variable type
similar to arrays, dictionaries, or objects
in other languages –
a set of ``key: value`` pairs
contained in a single variable.

Converting the brand-colors above
might look something like this:

.. code:: scss

  $brand-colors: (
    'primary':  darken(#428bca, 6.5%),
    'success':  #5cb85c,
    'info':     #5bc0de,
    'warning':  #f0ad4e,
    'danger':   #d9534f,
  ) !default;

Now the brand-colors are grouped explicitly,
clear to both humans and compilers,
with less clutter in the global namespace.


Other Map Advantages
--------------------

Maps provide other advantages over variables,
especially when you want to make programmatic adjustments.
In fact, maps were added to Sass
to replace *variable-name interpolation*.
New variables can’t be generated in Sass,
but new map keys can.
The following code attempts to create and save
lighter and darker versions
of our primary brand color.
This won’t work, using variables:

.. code:: scss

  @for each $adjustment in ('lighten', 'darken') {
    $new-color: call($adjustment, $brand-primary, 10%);

    // There is no Sass syntax for this…
    $brand-primary-#{$adjustment}: $new-color;
  }

But it does work, using map keys:

.. code:: scss

  @for each $adjustment in ('lighten', 'darken') {
    $new-color: call($adjustment, $brand-primary, 10%);
    $new-color-map: ('primary-#{$adjustment}': $new-color);

    $brand-colors: map-merge($brand-colors, $new-color-map);
  }

The same is true with accessing
variable names and map keys programmatically.
Using variables, it fails:

.. code:: scss

  @for each $header in ('h1', 'h2', 'h3') {
    #{$header} {
      @if variable-exists('font-size-#{$header}') {
        // There is no Sass syntax for this…
        font-size: $font-size-#{$header};
      }
    }
  }

Again, it works great with a map key:

.. code:: scss

  @for each $header in ('h1', 'h2', 'h3') {
    #{$header} {
      @if map-has-key($text-sizes, $header) {
        font-size: map-get($text-sizes, $header);
      }
    }
  }

That may not be a common use-case,
but it can come in handy
for automating repetitive patterns.
More important to OddBird’s daily use,
we can also automate some basic style guides
with very little effort –
looping through the maps
to get all the data we need.
We’ll get to that later.


The Map Problem
---------------

Of course,
no solution is perfect,
and maps come with their own problems.
Some are simple text-editor issues,
like the ability for most language-helpers
to autocomplete variable names,
but not map keys.
That's a minor frustration,
but there’s another map issue
that can really ruin your entire day:

Sass variables can easily reference other variables –
e.g ``$blue-gray: desaturate($blue, 20%);`` –
but **map values cannot reference other values in the same map**.

.. code:: scss

  $colors: (
    'blue': #339,
    'blue-gray': desaturate(map-get($colors, blue), 20%),
  );

  // SASS ERROR: Undefined variable: "$colors".

That's ugly,
and it doesn't work.
At the point where we are calling the map,
it hasn't yet been defined.
Technically, we could only
reference values from previously-defined maps,
and build our patterns that way –
but that gets even uglier:

.. code:: scss

  $colors: (
    'blue': #339,
  );

  $colors: map-merge($colors, (
    'blue-gray': desaturate(map-get($colors, blue), 20%),
  ));

What’s the point of grouping all your values
in a single variable,
if you have to define it
over and over,
one small piece at a time?

Lucky for you,
there’s nothing I love
more than over-engineering Sass tools...


A Functional Solution
---------------------

Clearly we have to make some changes to our map.
Instead of referencing and manipulating values directly,
we use an invented syntax
to define what references and manipulations
*should* happen:

.. code:: scss

  // Define first…
  $colors: (
    'blue': #339,
    'blue-gray': 'blue' ('desaturate': 20%),
  );

Our syntax has two parts:
a base color –
which can be any color-value,
or another key in the map –
and an optional map of adjustments,
including function names, and additional arguments:

.. code:: scss

  $color: (
    <name>: <base-color> (<function>: <arguments...>, …),
    'blue-gray': 'blue' ('desaturate': 20%, 'lighten': 15%),
  );

That's hopefully human-readable,
and loosely based on
functional programming standards,
but it will require processing
in order to work.
We need some functions
that know how to parse our syntax,
and return CSS-ready results.

At OddBird we have three abstract
"Sass `Accoutrement`_" toolkits
(`color`_, `scale`_, and `type`_)
each containing a core function
to compile our maps.
In the color module,
that function is simply called ``color()``,
and works like this:

.. code:: scss

  // Calculate on-the-fly…
  $result: color('blue-gray');

While ``'blue' ('desaturate': 20%)``
doesn’t mean anything special to Sass,
the ``color()`` function understands
how to parse that syntax,
and make the necessary conversions.
First it has to look up the reference color
(``#339`` above),
and then call the adjustment function mentioned
(``desaturate``),
passing in the base color
and the given argument (``20%``).

You can play with it yourself
in this CodePen demo:

.. raw:: html

  <p data-height="420" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="xqOwxe" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="mirisuzanne" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Accoutrement Color Example" data-editable="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/mirisuzanne/pen/xqOwxe/">Accoutrement Color Example</a> by Miriam Suzanne (<a href="http://codepen.io/mirisuzanne">@mirisuzanne</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
  <script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

As you can see,
that demo
also generates a rough style guide
on-the-fly,
with nothing but Sass
and empty ``div`` elements –
a pretty good proof-of-concept
for the more robust
style guide generator
we'll develop later.

The Theming Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There’s an interesting side effect of our solution
that I’ve never really dug into before now.
While variable relationships are static,
calculated at the point they are defined,
our relationships remain dynamic until they are called.

Let’s start with a few colors
defined as variables,
with one color based on the other color:

.. code:: scss

  $brand: #339;
  $brand-light: lighten($brand, 10%); // #4040bf

If I override the value of ``$brand``
later in the document,
that will have no effect
on the value of ``$brand-light``:

.. code:: scss

  $brand: #339;
  $brand-light: lighten($brand, 10%); // #4040bf

  $brand: #933;

  .static-variables {
    background: $brand-light; // #4040bf – still the same…
  }

The lighten-10% relationship is lost,
unless we re-define both colors at once.
If we do the same thing using Sass maps,
we get a different result:

.. code:: scss

  $colors: (
    'brand': #339,
    'brand-light': 'brand' ('lighten': 10%), // #4040bf
  );

  $colors: map-merge($colors, ('brand': #933));

  .dynamic-values {
    background: color('brand-light'); // #bf4040 – it changed!
  }

Keeping that relationship dynamic
could allow us to handle theming in new ways.
Change the base color on-the-fly,
and watch the results trickle down.


Trade-Offs
----------

We use the same approach
for colors, sizes, and fonts –
with additional helpers
to manage contrast-ratios,
modular-scales (when needed),
robust webfont importing,
and (most importantly)
automated style guides.

Since the abstract site configuration
is stored in a meaningful way,
we can `export all that data to JSON`_
and pass it along to a tool like `SassDoc`_
for display.
We're working on a SassDoc theme of our own,
called `Herman`_,
which knows how to display
color-palettes, type scales, and font specimens.

You can look at our
`OddSite config`_ files on Github,
and `see the generated docs`_ live.
Herman is far from complete,
but it's already been useful
in generating docs as we go –
with little extra effort.
Any time a new color is added to the map,
it is automatically available to our ``color()`` function,
and simultaneously appears in the style guide.
The pattern is documented directly in the code.

That meaningful structure provides a lot of power,
but comes with trade-offs.
We have to invent our own syntax,
which raises the learning curve for new developers,
and eliminates some text-editor autocomplete gains.
We've added dependencies to the project,
making it also more difficult to test ideas in
sandbox systems like `Codepen`_ and `Sassmeister`_.

Are those trade-offs worth it?
That depends on your needs,
and the needs of the project.
No solution is one-size fits all.
We hope some of these issues can be resolved
in our toolkit –
like adding a hosted sandbox to our style guides –
but your milage will almost certainly vary.
