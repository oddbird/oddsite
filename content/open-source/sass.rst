  Miriam is a member of the  **core team**,
  for the **industry-standard**
  CSS extension language.
summary: |
  **Sass is the most mature and powerful
  professional-grade CSS extension language in the world.**
  It allows you to use variables, nested rules,
  mixins, functions, and more,
  all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.
  Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized
  and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
  Over the years,
  Sass has become an industry-standard for developers,
  and a testing ground for new features
  that eventually land in CSS.
