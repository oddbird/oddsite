summary: |
  **We use open source software regularly**
  in our personal and professional work,
  to stay up-to-date with community best practice
  and avoid re-inventing any wheels.
  We appreciate the generosity of so many in the open source community,
  and try to contribute back to the projects we use,
  and share our own tools that might be useful to others.
