summary: |
  Helium is a floating browser window
  that allows you to watch media,
  browse the web,
  and do much more while you stay productive.
  Your content will never fall behind your other windows
  even as you switch tasks.
  Helium supports a customizable translucency mode
  that allows you to simultaneously see your content and your work,
  without intercepting mouse clicks when it's translucent.
  You have the ability to click, drag,
  and scroll behind your floating content.
