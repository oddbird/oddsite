summary: |
  **We're constantly learning**
  from the inspiration and mentoring of others,
  so we like to pass that knowledge along:
  talking and `writing`_
  about the tools and practices
  that have helped improve our work.
  We also provide workshops and in-house trainings --
  to help `improve design systems`_,
  designer-developer communication,
  site performance, and accessibility.

  **Founders** `Miriam`_ **and** `Carl`_
  **are internationally known**
  for their open source
  contributions to `Sass/CSS`_ and `Django/Python`_,
  respectively.
  We've written the books,
  contributed to the languages,
  and built the tools for other developers.
  *We don't just follow best-practice –
  we help define it.*
