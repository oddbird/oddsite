summary: |
  CSS is the design language of the web --
  one of three core web languages --
  but it also seems to be the most contentious and often perplexing.
  Itâ€™s too easy and too hard,
  too fragile and too resilient.
  Love it or hate it, CSS is weird:
  not quite markup,
  not quite programming in the imperative sense,
  and nothing like the design programs we use for print.
  How did we get here?


Why is CSS so Weird?
====================

  CSS is for documents,
  and also for apps
  on a universally accessible web.

This is a young platform, and all the core languages are growing fast,
with CSS advancing leaps and bounds over the last few years,
but there's a real problem we can't ignore --
the web is *display-agnostic*:

  This implies no device-specific markup,
  **or anything which requires control over fonts or colors.**

Here we are,
putting fonts and colors on the web.
But it's worth taking a step back and asking:
what does it even mean to **design** on an unknown and infinite canvas?
This problem isn't new, it's not going away, and there are no simple answers.
Design on the web will always be weird --
but CSS is a `living document`_,
and we have the power to `keep making it better`_.
