summary: |
  Sass recently launched a major new feature
  you might recognize from other languages:
  a module system.
  The new syntax will replace ``@import`` with
  ``@use`` and ``@forward`` --
  a big step forward for making Sass partials
  (one of the languages most used features)
  more readable, performant, and safe.
  This article goes into detail,
  but you can also read our
  "`Sass Modules, a Primer </2019/10/02/sass-modules>`_" article
  for the quick introduction.
