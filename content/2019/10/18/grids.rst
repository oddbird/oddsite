summary: |
  CSS Grid has been available in most major browsers since early 2017,
  and it makes web layout more powerful than ever before.
  But complex-looking new syntax
  (line-names! grid-areas! ``minmax``! ``fit-content``! ``fr units``!)
  and missing IE11 support can make it scary to many developers.


Faster Layouts with CSS Grid
============================

Don't let that stop you:
CSS Grid has made my layout process faster and simpler,
with more flexibility.
We can get started with a few basics,
and the fallbacks don't have to be overwhelming:

.. callmacro:: content.macros.j2#video
  :embed: '<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KOvGeFUHAC0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>'

With Subgrid,
we can also start to lay out nested elements on a shared grid:

.. callmacro:: content.macros.j2#video
  :embed: '<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLnFtK1LNu4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>'

  Subgrid for Better Card Layouts, with fallbacks for legacy browsers
