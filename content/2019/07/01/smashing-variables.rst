summary: |
  Miriam takes a deeper dive into the
  *CSS Custom Properties for Cascading Variables* specification to ask,
  “Why are they called custom properties,
  how do they work in the cascade,
  and what else can we do with them?”
  Pushing past the “variable” metaphor,
  custom properties can provide new ways
  to balance context and isolation in CSS patterns and components.
