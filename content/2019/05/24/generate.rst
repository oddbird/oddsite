The Scary & the Inspiring
=========================

Josh Clark
----------

AI is your new design material
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After listening to Josh Clarkâ€™s description
of how to use AI to amplify human experience â€”
give machines the time-consuming,
repetitive tasks they do best â€”
Iâ€™m maybe not as off-put by AI as I was before.
There are scary bias problems with AI
(like this from a recent article in `Forbes`_).
But if we can use those results
to help expose and address bias as Josh suggested,
Iâ€™m all in.

Dynamic CSS: Layouts & Beyond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I attended Miriam Suzanneâ€™s workshop
on Advanced CSS and her talk on Dynamic CSS.
It was a blizzard of useful information
about CSS Grid, variables, interactions between CSS and JS,
and much more.
If you're curious,
check out the full video.
If you were at either Generate or Smashing Conf
and still want more,
Miriam answers attendee questions in `Smashing CSS Followup`_.

Sam Richard

Design System Magic with Houdini
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sam Richard handed me a cute little rabbit sticker
and introduced Houdini.
Both blew my mind.

Sophia Prater
-------------

UX for Lizard Brains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was sad to miss Sophia Praterâ€™s talk and workshop,
but I had the opportunity to meet her
and really appreciated her offer
to discuss my recent experiments
in Object Oriented UX.
It was challenging
to think about design like a data model,
but it was also useful â€”
and cut down noticeably
on project planning time.

Adekunle Oduye
--------------

Rapid Prototyping with Gatsby
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adekunle Oduye gave us an overview
of rapid prototyping with Gatsby â€”
create a design system,
set up Gatsby,
and start prototyping with code.
Itâ€™s a super efficient way
to communicate designs to developers.

Aaron Irizarry
--------------

Groundwork: Building Foundations for High-Performing Teams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aaron Irizarry confirmed my anecdotal experience
about the factors that make a high performance team:
create a psychologically safe work environment,
avoid micromanagement and low standards,
allow autonomy,
provide clear expectations, stakes, goals, and evaluations,
and teach people how to think.
Thanks, OddBird,
for challenging me to do my best work
in a thoroughly supportive space. ðŸŽ‰

Jen Simmons
-----------

Everything You Know About Web Design Just Changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Miriam and I had the privilege
of watching Jen Simmons live-code
a fiendishly difficult layout
(that we selected for her)
using CSS Grid.
Wow!
Such exciting new possibilities!

Irene Pereyra
-------------

Getting Personal Projects Made
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The talk that stuck with me the most
was Irene Pereyraâ€™s Getting Personal Projects Made.
OddBird has always tried to construct itself
around team member needs
instead of asking people
to fit into a more standard structure â€”
flexing as needs change,
and staying committed
when external forces push us to conform.
We offer OSS project time
to team members
and are slowly building OddBooks,
a collaborative writing tool.
Her talk was like a shot of raw inspiration.

Irene runs her own design studio
with Anton Repponen.
They made a commitment early on
to focus 60% of their time on client work
and 40% on personal projects
and have stuck to it through the bombs and wild successes.
For personal projects,
they play around without clear goals.
They pursue ideas that make them nervous.
And they get help from friends and colleagues
in adjacent fields.
When Irene started on One Shared House,
an interactive documentary about her childhood,
she didnâ€™t have high expectations.
She certainly didnâ€™t expect it
to lead to a project with IKEA:
One Shared House 2030,
an imagining of co-living in the future.
Some Anton & Irene projects are still costing them money,
but satisfaction with their work is high.
And whatâ€™s all this work for anyway,
if not increased happiness?

What's Next?
------------

Riding this wave of excitement,
I plan to cash in on some of that OSS time OddBird offers
to work on one of the projects
thatâ€™s been percolating in my mind
for a while.
Iâ€™m thinking either an icon set
(what new ideas can I bring to this crowded space?)
or a tool for outlining writing projects
(this one scares me the most!).
Whatever happens,
youâ€™ll be among the first to know.
