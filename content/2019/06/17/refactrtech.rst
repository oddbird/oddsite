      Refactr.tech 2019 aims to solve tech's diversity problem

summary: |
  As we readied our seats for the first ever `Refactr.tech Conference`_, I
  pondered the question: What would a technical conference look like if its
  organizers were intentional about inclusiveness but still centered on tech?

Diversity. Inclusion. Tech.
===========================

Why this matters.
-----------------

For three days, technologists from many parts of the country gathered in Atlanta
GA – a melting pot of human experience in itself – to realize just that.
`Refactr.tech`_ showcased growing and powerful voices of underrepresented
professionals in tech and their allies; with a focus on technology and creating
a safe space to have conversations around diversity, inclusion, and
intersectionality in tech.

  I knew I was in the right place as I met so many people I already follow on
  Twitter.

First, I'd like to thank the awesome women of `Vue Vixens`_ for sponsoring my
ticket for the conference. Refactr.tech is a re-branding of sorts of `We RISE`_,
a conference organized by Women Who Code Atlanta, that has for the last few
years provided a space to grow and showcase the work of women in technology.

With the inauguration of Refactr.tech, that experience has been expanded to not
just women, but all underrepresented technologists and their allies. This was
great because we don’t have the luxury of just working with women in our
everyday lives, and everyone needs to be in on the conversation to really get a
well-rounded perspective on what D&I is and how we can build better workplace
cultures around this idea.

Of course, women-focused events have their place, though some miss the mark on
acknowledging intersectionality and understanding the unique challenges that
say, queer and minority women face in the workplace. D&I is much more nuanced
than just “we need more women.”

We know that diversity makes good business sense and that companies that work
towards gender, racial and ethnic diversity see financial gains above industry
medians; but I love how the organizers of this conference took the conversation 
further than just its economic benefits.

Here's a recap.
---------------

There were the familiar formats for attendees to learn and make connections. Day
one hosted full-day workshops on things like `GraphQL`_, `Flutter`_, `Gatsby`_
and more. There was a `Vue Skulk`_, where I assume there were foxy Vue things
going on. I’m sad to have missed the first day for mom things, but ran into an
old co-worker who attended the Flutter workshop. It was his first experience
with it, and in short-order he discovered that Flutter is indeed fun and easy to
work with.

Day two and three were dedicated to the standard keynotes and track sessions.
`Tracy Lee`_ of `This Dot Labs`_ was on brand delivering the first keynote on
how D&I makes good business sense, all while donning a prom dress. Day Two’s
keynote took a more personal tone with `Dr. Kortney Ziegler`_ explaining how
embracing his story has helped him find purpose in his endeavors at `ZaMLabs`_.

Track sessions included Front-End Engineering, Software Engineering, Product &
UX, Cool Sh!t, Career & Leadership, and Social Impact. I tried my best to get in
on talks from each track. Speakers with various pathways into technology and
levels of experience brought their own voices to present their passions, ideas,
and tips and tricks.

`Mike Harington`_ from the `Ionic`_ team went beyond the basics of what makes a
website a progressive web app and demonstrated through code and personal
experience which of the big three JavaScript frameworks offers the most support
out of the box.

`Tae’lur Alexis`_ of `codeeveryday.io`_ gave us the tea on her newfound passion
with accessibility. The inspiration for her talk just might have been divine
providence as she’s been apparently working through issues with her eyesight.

I got to sit in on perhaps `the most diverse panel of technologists`_ I’ve ever
seen giving clutch information on what it’s like betting on yourself through
entrepreneurship, building your community, and funding your ideas in a world
where venture-capitalists may overlook you for being a woman or a minority.

`Sangeeta Nori`_ from GM demystified `quantum computing`_ for us and
demonstrated how companies are leveraging this very complicated technology to
solve problems of today and tomorrow. My immediate thought was: *How can this be
used to tackle climate change, perhaps the most pressing issue of our time?* It
was fun to chat her up while playing Uno during happy hour, to learn that she is
struggling to learn Angular during her day job, just like me.

I sat in on a panel with A* members of `/dev/color`_ from Netflix on being
authentic leading teams while black in Silicon Valley  –  showing there is
strength in a shared experience and knowing that you’re not alone.

`Alexandra Millatmal`_ of `Newsela`_ channeled her personal “othered” experience
in her talk, "Mentoring the way to diversity and inclusion". It was a
call-to-action for companies to make cultural shifts in how they hire, onboard
and mold upcoming talent; talent that perhaps have less-than-conventional paths
to get where they are – and how mentoring junior engineers and bolstering D&I
efforts work hand-in-hand.

`Nick Caldwell`_, Chief Product Officer at `Looker (now Google)`_ talked about
his career journey from engineer to VP and some leadership principles he’s
developed on the way that allowed him to grow successful teams for companies
like Microsoft and Reddit.

I even learned something from the not-so-good talks (there were a couple). But
for someone like me – an up-and-coming developer with her own goals to join the
conference circuit – it’s refreshing to know that not everyone is a rock star and
that there is space for me to one day present my ideas and experiences to my
peers.

Final Thoughts.
---------------

All in all, the two days I spent there were inspiring and readied me to go back
to work and do great things. Working with companies that value diversity and
inclusion (especially) is a high priority for me. By working with people from
different backgrounds and with different experiences and working styles, we
learn and get another view. Diverse views make for better decisions that benefit
the heterogeneous nature of end users, and drive a high-performance culture.

I’m pleased to work with people who know the value of making connections at
these types of events. I also feel gratitude towards Vue Vixens for their part
in helping create the experience for this OddBird.
