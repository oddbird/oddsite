      I think it's a brilliant idea.
      Almost want to stop talking about whether or not to do it,
      and just start talking syntax.

  **I've joined the CSS Working Group
  as a W3C Invited Expert**
  to help to develop the next level of
  Cascading & Inheritance,
  in addition to other CSS standards.
  I'm also currently active in the
  `CSS4 <https://www.w3.org/community/css4/>`_
  and `Design Token <https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/>`_
  Community Groups.


W3C Invited Expert on the CSS Working Group
===========================================

I was invited to join
after the CSSWG approved work on my
proposal for extending the
CSS Cascade & Inheritance module,
so that authors can define
`custom CSS origins`_.
Jen Simmons presented the proposal
at a CSSWG "face-to-face" meeting,
along with `supporting slides`_.
I'll write a more detailed article
with details about the proposal soon.

.. _custom CSS origins: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4470
.. _supporting slides: https://noti.st/jensimmons/QOEOYT/three-topics#s5swA20

In the meantime,
it's an honor to join the W3C,
and help define the future of a language I love.
I have a lot to learn about the process,
but I'm excited to start contributing!
