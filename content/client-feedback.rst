Getting Feedback
================

Creating web applications is a highly collaborative process, requiring input from many parties. We all need to work together closely to develop an app that is both visually stunning and effective at meeting business objectives. Here are a few suggestions for how you can keep us in line:

Focus on user needs & business objectives.
------------------------------------------

Don't get bogged down in the details.
That's where we work, but you can keep the larger picture in mind.
Ask these two questions:

1. How will users respond to this design?
2. Will it meet my business objectives?

State problems, not solutions.
------------------------------

Our job is to solve problems,
but you know best what the problems are.
If you are concerned that a feature won't actually work well for your users,
explain why you think that,
rather than telling us how to change it.
Let us take that information and work out the best solution.

Always present context.
-----------------------

We will spend hours discussing the right approach for your application,
and we’ll all have a firm grasp of why certain decisions have been made.
We also know where we are in the process,
what is complete and what is not.
The danger comes when you present work to colleagues
who don’t have that background.
In order to get useful feedback,
make sure that everyone you show the application to
is fully briefed on the important decisions
and the current stage of development.

Avoid design-by-committee.
--------------------------

Showing a work in progress to too many people
can muddy the decision-making process.
Keep the number of people involved to a minimum,
and ask their opinions individually
to avoid design-by-committee.
Remember that individuals will have different
and often contradictory opinions.
Reacting to every individual concern will result in endless,
unfocused changes.
Collate all the responses & look for patterns.
Where are the problems and what are they related to?

Always ask why.
---------------

When people tell you what they think of the design,
always ask them why.
Why don’t they like the color?
Why do they think the logo should be bigger?
Ask yourself the same questions.
Often there are underlying reasons for a reaction towards a design.
Sharing these underlying reasons will help us to find the best solutions.

Recognize personal bias.
------------------------

Design can be highly subjective.
We all have our personal opinion when it comes to design.
What you like, your boss may hate.
However, at the end of the day
it’s not about whether either you or your boss likes the design.
The question to ask is whether the user will like it.

Listen to the research.
-----------------------

There is considerable science and psychology
behind user interface design,
as well as many years of research.
Where possible, build on best practice
and avoid working from hunches or personal preference.

When in doubt, test.
--------------------

If you find yourself unsure about the design direction
or disagreeing over the way forward,
test the design.
There are many ways to get feedback
from a bigger group of people,
and none of them need to be time consuming or expensive.
Testing the design will give you the confidence
that things are heading in the right direction,
and show you where changes are needed.
